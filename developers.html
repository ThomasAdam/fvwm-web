Fvwm was 
created by Robert Nation, originally derived from <code>twm</code>
code.  Thanks, Rob!

<p>
Rob then passed the torch on to Charles Hines, who passed the torch to
Brady Montz.
The Fvwm 
torch is now carried by lots of people on the <code>fvwm-workers</code> list.
Jason Tibbitts continues to provide infrastructure in the form of
mailing lists, a web site, an FTP site, a CVS tree, and anonymous rsync.
<p>

curious, these links may be of interest to you:
