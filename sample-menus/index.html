	Fvwm gives you lots of ways to decorate menus.
	This page shows sample menus
	that have been contributed to fvwm.
        Click on the menu to download the Fvwm commands needed to
        configure the menu.
    <table>
      <tr><td>
	  <a href="BlueMarble.fvwmrc"><img src="BlueMarble.gif"
	      alt="Blue Marble Menu" align=left></a></td>
	<td>
	  Sample menu submitted by Dan Espen using background pixmaps.
	  Click here for
	  the <a href="weird10dark.xpm">background pixmap</a>.
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    If you have a sample menu that you would like to contribute
    you can mail it to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.
    The sample menu must show one item selected, and one item grayed
    out.  A grayed out menu item can be created by including a "Delete"
    selection and bring the menu up on a window that sets the
    do not delete property.  FvwmTalk can be used for this.
