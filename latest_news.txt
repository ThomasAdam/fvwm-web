* user settings given via url like
   http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/screenshots/screenshots_desks.php?window_bg=%234444aa&pager_bg=%23aaaaaa
  are now propagated to sub pages.

Sun Mar 30 2003 [uwe]:
* added fvwm_cats/index.php with pager icon
* new variable $default_settings_array which holds the default
  settings of color and image definitions
  This variable may be passed to sub pages - not implemented yet
* changed the rules to build the pager, so that sub pages do not get
  an own desk if the following rules are satisfied:
    - the site has no subpages
    - its parent has not more subpages than the number of pages on one
      desk
    - it parent is a top site
  The pager on the web site behaves now more like a pager in fvwm ;-)
  Maybe more rules are needed to get a better behaviour.

Fri Mar 28 2003 [uwp]:
* Shell script which generates icons for a text pager:
    temporary/helpers/create_pager_text_icon.sh
  and a php script which produces ouput that can be used to used the
  shell script for the web tree:
    temporary/helpers/create_pager_text_icon.php
* Added a new layout with a pager having text instead of mini icons. </pre><a href="http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/?layout=text_pager">http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/?layout=text_pager</a><pre>
  The size of the windows in the pager might to be changed.
* Moved download.php to download/index.php, same for contact.php,
  documentation.php and screenshots.php

Thu Mar 27 2003 [uwp]:
* Added the news entry on development of this web site to index.php. 
* Changed the border of the pager to style "window_deco_ice"
* Added alt and title attribute to the pager links

Wed Mar 26 2003 [uwp]:
* Finished the pager navigation algorithm. The pager shows now always
  the path back to the FVWM Home/Start page.
* New function "insert_quick_jump_list" to insert a list of direct
  links on the start page. The entries in the quick jump list are
  taken from the specification in the file headers.
* Created a template file and a simple shell schript to produce php
  files belonging to this file tree.
* Added new empty sub pages doc_faq.php doc_manpages.php and
  download_icons.php.
