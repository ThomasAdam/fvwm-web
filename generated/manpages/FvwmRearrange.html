       FvwmRearrange - rearrange FVWM windows


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmRearrange is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invo-
       cation will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This module can be called to tile or cascade windows.

       When tiling the module attempts to  tile  windows  on  the
       current screen subject to certain constraints.  Horizontal
       or vertical tiling is performed so that each  window  does
       not overlap another, and by default each window is resized
       to its nearest resize increment (note sometimes some space
       might appear between tiled windows -- this is why).

       When  cascading  the module attempts to cascade windows on
       the current screen subject to certain constraints.  Layer-
       ing  is  performed  so consecutive windows will have their
       window titles visible underneath the previous.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       FvwmRearrange is best invoked from a menu, pop up or  but-
       ton.  There are a number of command line options which can
       be used to constrain the  layering,  these  are  described
       below.   As  an example case, one could call FvwmRearrange
       with the following arguments:

            FvwmRearrange -tile -h 10 10 90 90

       or

            FvwmRearrange -cascade -resize 10 2 80 70


       The first invocation will horizontally tile windows with a
       bounding  box  which  starts  at 10 by 10 percent into and
       down the screen and ends at 90 by 90 percent into and down
       the screen.

       The  second invocation will cascade windows starting 10 by
       2 percent into and down the screen.  Windows will be  con-
       strained  to  80  by  70 percent of the screen dimensions.
       Since the  <font color="yellow">resize</font color="yellow">  is  also  specified,  windows  will  be
       resized to the given constrained width and height.

       FvwmRearrange  can  be  called as FvwmTile or FvwmCascade.
       This is equivalent to  providing  the  -tile  or  -cascade
       option.  This  form is obsolete and supplied for backwards
       compatibility only.
       described here.

       -a     Causes  <font color="yellow">all</font color="yellow"> window styles to be affected, even ones
              with the WindowListSkip style.

       -cascade
              Cascade windows. This argument must be the first on
              the command line.  This is the default.

       -desk  Causes all windows on the desk to be cascaded/tiled
              instead of the current screen only.

       -flatx Inhibits border width  increment.  Only  used  when
              cascading.

       -flaty Inhibits  border  height  increment. Only used when
              cascading.

       -h     Tiles horizontally (default is to tile vertically).
              Used for tiling only.

       -incx <font color="yellow">arg</font color="yellow">
              Specifies  a  horizontal increment which is succes-
              sively added to cascaded windows.  <font color="yellow">arg</font color="yellow">  is  a  per-
              centage  of  screen width, or pixel value if a <font color="yellow">p</font color="yellow"> is
              suffixed.  Default is zero. Used only  for  cascad-
              ing.

       -incy <font color="yellow">arg</font color="yellow">
              Specifies  a  vertical  increment  which is succes-
              sively added to cascaded windows.  <font color="yellow">arg</font color="yellow">  is  a  per-
              centage  of screen height, or pixel value if a <font color="yellow">p</font color="yellow"> is
              suffixed.  Default is zero. Used only  for  cascad-
              ing.


       -m     Causes   maximized  windows  to  also  be  affected
              (implied by -all).

       -mn <font color="yellow">arg</font color="yellow">
              Tiles up to <font color="yellow">arg</font color="yellow"> windows in tile direction.  If more
              windows  exist,  a  new  direction row or column is
              created (in effect, a matrix is created). Used only
              when tiling windows.

       -noraise
              Inhibits window raising, leaving the depth ordering
              intact.

       -noresize
              Inhibits  window  resizing,  leaving  window  sizes
              intact. This is the default when cascading windows.
              If tiling: inhibits  window  growth  to  fit  tile.
              Windows   are  shrunk  to  fit  the  tile  but  not
              expanded.

              If cascading: inhibits window expansion when  using
              the  -resize  option.   Windows will only shrink to
              fit the maximal width and height (if given).

       -r     Reverses the window sequence.

       -resize
              Forces all windows to  resize  to  the  constrained
              width  and  height  (if given). This is the default
              when tiling windows.

       -s     Causes sticky windows to also be affected  (implied
              by -all).

       -t     Causes   transient  windows  to  also  be  affected
              (implied by -all).

       -tile  Tile windows. This argument must be  the  first  on
              the command line.

       -u     Causes   untitled   windows  to  also  be  affected
              (implied by -all).

              Up to four numbers can be  placed  on  the  command
              line that are not switches.  The first pair specify
              an x  and  y  offset  to  start  the  first  window
              (default  is 0, 0).  The meaning of the second pair
              depends on operation mode:

              When tiling windows it specifies an absolute  coor-
              dinate  reference denoting the lower right bounding
              box for tiling.

              When cascading it specifies  a  maximal  width  and
              height for the layered windows. If an affected win-
              dow exceeds either this  width  or  height,  it  is
              resized to the maximal width or height.

              If  any  number is suffixed with the letter p, then
              it is taken to be a pixel value,  otherwise  it  is
              interpreted  as  a  screen  percentage.  Specifying
              zero for any parameter is equivalent to not  speci-
              fying it.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       It  is  probably  not  a good idea to delete windows while
       windows are being rearranged.
