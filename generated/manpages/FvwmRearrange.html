<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     FvwmRearrange - rearrange FVWM windows


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmRearrange is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invoca-
     tion will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     This module can be called to tile or cascade windows.

     When tiling the module  attempts  to  tile  windows  on  the
     current  screen  subject to certain constraints.  Horizontal
     or vertical tiling is performed so that each window does not
     overlap  another,  and  by default each window is resized to
     its nearest resize  increment  (note  sometimes  some  space
     might appear between tiled windows -- this is why).

     When cascading the module attempts to cascade windows on the
     current  screen subject to certain constraints.  Layering is
     performed so consecutive  windows  will  have  their  window
     titles visible underneath the previous.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
     FvwmRearrange is best invoked from a menu, popup or  button.
     There are a number of command line options which can be used
     to constrain the layering, these are described below.  As an
     example  case, one could call FvwmRearrange with the follow-
     ing arguments:

          FvwmRearrange -tile -h 10 10 90 90

     or

          FvwmRearrange -cascade -resize 10 2 80 70


     The first invocation will horizontally tile windows  with  a
     bounding  box which starts at 10 by 10 percent into and down
     the screen and ends at 90 by 90 percent into  and  down  the
     screen.

     The second invocation will cascade windows starting 10 by  2
     percent  into  and  down  the  screen.  Windows will be con-
     strained to 80 by  70  percent  of  the  screen  dimensions.
     Since  the <font color="yellow">resize</font color="yellow"> is also specified, windows will be resized
     to the given constrained width and height.

     FvwmRearrange can be called as FvwmTile or FvwmCascade. This
     is  equivalent  to  providing  the -tile or -cascade option.
     This  form  is   obsolete   and   supplied   for   backwards
     compatibility only.

     Command-line arguments passed to FvwmRearrange are described
     here.

     -a   Causes <font color="yellow">all</font color="yellow"> window styles to be affected, even ones with
          the WindowListSkip style.

     -cascade
          Cascade windows. This argument must be the first on the
          command line.  This is the default.

     -desk
          Causes all windows on the  desk  to  be  cascaded/tiled
          instead of the current screen only.

     -flatx
          Inhibits border width increment. Only used when cascad-
          ing.

     -flaty
          Inhibits border height increment. Only used  when  cas-
          cading.

     -h   Tiles horizontally (default  is  to  tile  vertically).
          Used for tiling only.

     -incx <font color="yellow">arg</font color="yellow">
          Specifies a horizontal increment which is  successively
          added  to  cascaded  windows.   <font color="yellow">arg</font color="yellow">  is a percentage of
          screen width, or  pixel  value  if  a  <font color="yellow">p</font color="yellow">  is  suffixed.
          Default is zero. Used only for cascading.

     -incy <font color="yellow">arg</font color="yellow">
          Specifies a vertical increment  which  is  successively
          added  to  cascaded  windows.   <font color="yellow">arg</font color="yellow">  is a percentage of
          screen height, or pixel  value  if  a  <font color="yellow">p</font color="yellow">  is  suffixed.
          Default is zero. Used only for cascading.


     -m   Causes maximized windows to also be  affected  (implied
          by -all).

     -mn <font color="yellow">arg</font color="yellow">
          Tiles up to <font color="yellow">arg</font color="yellow"> windows in  tile  direction.   If  more
          windows exist, a new direction row or column is created
          (in effect, a matrix is created). Used only when tiling
          windows.

     -noraise
          Inhibits window raising,  leaving  the  depth  ordering
          intact.

     -noresize
          Inhibits window resizing, leaving window sizes  intact.
          This is the default when cascading windows.

     -nostretch
          If tiling: inhibits window growth to fit tile.  Windows
          are shrunk to fit the tile but not expanded.

          If cascading: inhibits window expansion when using  the
          -resize  option.   Windows  will only shrink to fit the
          maximal width and height (if given).

     -r   Reverses the window sequence.

     -resize
          Forces all windows to resize to the  constrained  width
          and  height (if given). This is the default when tiling
          windows.

     -s   Causes sticky windows to also be affected  (implied  by
          -all).

     -t   Causes transient windows to also be  affected  (implied
          by -all).

     -tile
          Tile windows. This argument must be the  first  on  the
          command line.

     -u   Causes untitled windows to also be affected (implied by
          -all).

          Up to four numbers can be placed on  the  command  line
          that are not switches.  The first pair specify an x and
          y offset to start the first window (default is  0,  0).
          The  meaning  of  the  second pair depends on operation
          mode:

          When tiling windows it specifies an absolute coordinate
          reference  denoting  the  lower  right bounding box for
          tiling.

          When cascading it specifies a maximal width and  height
          for  the layered windows. If an affected window exceeds
          either this width or height, it is resized to the maxi-
          mal width or height.

          If any number is suffixed with the letter p, then it is
          taken  to be a pixel value, otherwise it is interpreted
          as a screen percentage.  Specifying zero for any param-
          eter is equivalent to not specifying it.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     It is probably not a good idea to delete windows while  win-
     dows are being rearranged.
