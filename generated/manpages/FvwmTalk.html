<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     FvwmTalk - the FVWM command line interface


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmTalk is spawned by fvwm, so no command  line  invocation
     will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The FvwmTalk allows the user to type fvwm  commands  into  a
     window,  and  have them executed immediately. These commands
     are usually specfified in the .fvwmrc file, or are bound  to
     menu/mouse  items  as  specified in that file. This tools is
     particularly useful for testing new configuration ideas,  or
     for implementing temporary changes to your environment.



</PRE>
<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>
     The FvwmTalk program, and the concept for  interfacing  this
     module  to  the  Window  Manager,  are  all original work by
     Robert Nation

     Copyright 1994, Robert Nation. No guarantees  or  warranties
     or  anything  are provided or implied in any way whatsoever.
     Use this program at your own risk. Permission  to  use  this
     program  for  any purpose is given, as long as the copyright
     is kept intact.




</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
     So kill me, I can't remember what goes on.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
     FvwmTalk can  be  invoked  by  inserting  the  line  'Module
     FvwmTalk'  in the .fvwmrc file. This can be placed on a line
     by itself, if FvwmTalk is to be spawned during  fvwm's  ini-
     tialization,  or  can  be bound to a menu or mouse button or
     keystroke to invoke it later.  Fvwm  will  search  directory
     specified  in the ModulePath configuration option to attempt
     to locate FvwmTalk.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     I plead ignorance here. Read the code.
