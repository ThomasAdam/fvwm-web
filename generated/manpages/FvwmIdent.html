<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     FvwmIdent - the FVWM identify-window module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmIdent is spawned by fvwm, so no command line  invocation
     will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The FvwmIdent module prompts the user  to  select  a  target
     window,  if the module was not launched from within a window
     context in Fvwm.  After that,  it  pops  up  a  window  with
     information about the window which was selected.

     FvwmIdent reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads when  it
     starts  up, and looks for lines similar to "*FvwmIdent: Fore
     green".



</PRE>
<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>
     The FvwmIdent program, and the concept for interfacing  this
     module  to  the  Window  Manager,  are  all original work by
     Robert Nation Nobutaka Suzuki.

     Copyright  1994,  Robert  Nation  and  Nobutaka  Suzuki.  No
     guarantees or warranties or anything are provided or implied
     in any way whatsoever. Use this program at  your  own  risk.
     Permission  to use this program for any purpose is given, as
     long as the copyright is kept intact.




</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
     During initialization, <font color="yellow">FvwmIdent</font color="yellow"> will  eventually  search  a
     configuration  file  which  describes the colors and font to
     use.  The configuration file is the same file that fvwm used
     during initialization.

     If the FvwmIdent executable is linked to another name, ie ln
     -s   FvwmIdent  MoreIdentify,  then  another  module  called
     MoreIdentify can be started,  with  a  completely  different
     configuration than FvwmIdent, simply by changing the keyword
     FvwmIdent  to  MoreIdentify.  This  way  multiple   clutter-
     reduction programs can be used.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
     FvwmIdent can be  invoked  by  binding  the  action  'Module
     FvwmIdent'  to  a  menu  or  key-stroke in the .fvwmrc file.
     Fvwm will search directory specified in the ModulePath  con-
     figuration  option  to attempt to locate FvwmIdent. Although
     nothing keeps you from launching FvwmIdent at start-up time,
     you probably don't want to.  Klicking into the the FvwmIdent
     window  or  pressing  a  key  while  it  has  focus   closes
     FvwmIdent.  Pressing  mouse  button 2 in the window restarts
     FvwmIdent and asks for a new window to select.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmIdent reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads when  it
     starts up, and looks for lines as listed below:


     *FvwmIdent: Colorset <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow">
          Tells the module to use colorset <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow">. See FvwmTheme.


     *FvwmIdent: Fore <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Tells the module to use  <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">  instead  of  black  for
          text. Switches off the Colorset option.


     *FvwmIdent: Back <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Tells the module to use <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow"> instead of white for  the
          window background. Switches off the Colorset option.


     *FvwmIdent: Font <font color="yellow">fontname</font color="yellow">
          Tells the module to use <font color="yellow">fontname</font color="yellow"> instead of  fixed  for
          text.
