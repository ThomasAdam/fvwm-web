<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     FvwmCpp - the FVWM  Cpp pre-processor


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmCpp is spawned by fvwm, so no  command  line  invocation
     will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     When called, this module will attempt to  have  /usr/lib/cpp
     pre-process  the  file specified in its invocation, and then
     have fvwm read the resulting file.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
     FvwmCpp can be invoked by inserting the  line  'FvwmCpp'  in
     the  .fvwm2rc  file.  It  can  also be called from a menu or
     mouse binding.  If the user wants his entire  .fvwm2rc  file
     pre-processed with FvwmCpp, then fvwm should be invoked as:


          fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmCpp .fvwm2rc"


     Some options can be specified on the command line:

     -cppopt <font color="yellow">option</font color="yellow">
          Lets you pass an option to the cpp program.  Not really
          needed  as  any  unknown  options  will  be  passed  on
          automatically.


     -cppprog <font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow">
          Instead of invoking "/usr/lib/cpp",  fvwm  will  invoke
          <font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow">.


     -outfile <font color="yellow">filename</font color="yellow">
          Instead of creating a random unique name for  the  tem-
          porary  file  for the preprocessed rc file, this option
          will let you specify the name of the temporary file  it
          will create.


     -debug
          Causes the temporary file create by Cpp to be retained.
          This file is usually called "/tmp/fvwmrcXXXXXX"




</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmCpp defines some values for  use  in  the  pre-processor
     file:


     TWM_TYPE
          Always set to "fvwm".

     SERVERHOST
          The name of the machine running the X Server.

     CLIENTHOST
          The name of the machine running fvwm.

     HOSTNAME
          The hostname of the machine running fvwm. Generally the
          same as CLIENTHOST.

     OSTYPE
          The operating system for CLIENTHOST.

     USER The name of the person running fvwm.

     VERSION
          The X11 version.

     REVISION
          The X11 revision number.

     VENDOR
          The X server vendor.

     RELEASE
          The X server release number.

     WIDTH
          The screen width in pixels.

     HEIGHT
          The screen height in pixels.

     X_RESOLUTION
          Some  distance/pixel  measurement  for  the  horizontal
          direction, I think.

     Y_RESOLUTION
          Some distance/pixel measurement for the vertical direc-
          tion, I think.

     PLANES
          Number of color planes for the X server display

     BITS_PER_RGB
          Number of bits in each rgb triplet.

     CLASS
          The X11 visual class, ie PsuedoColor.

     COLOR
          Yes or No, Yes if the display  class  is  neither  Sta-
          ticGrey or GreyScale.

     FVWM_VERSION
          The fvwm version number, ie 2.0

     OPTIONS
          Some combination of SHAPE, XPM, NO_SAVEUNDERS, and Cpp,
          as defined in configure.h at compile time.

     FVWM_MODULEDIR
          The directory where fvwm looks for .fvwmrc and  modules
          by default, as determined at compile time.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     Module configurations do not become active until  fvwm2  has
     restarted  if  you use FvwmCpp on startup. FvwmCpp creates a
     temporary file and passes this to fvwm2, so you  would  have
     to  edit  this  file too.  There are some problems with com-
     ments  in  your  .fvwm2rc  file.   The  comment  sign  #  is
     misinterpreted  by  the  preprocessor.   This has usually no
     impact on functionality but generates annoying warning  mes-
     sages.   The  sequence /* is interpreted as the start of a C
     comment what is probably not what you want  in  a  filename.
     You  might  want  to  try /?* (for filenames only) or /\* or
     "/*" instead.  Macros are not replaced within single (')  or
     double  quotes  (").  Use backquotes (`) to circumvent this.
     Fvwm2 accepts backquotes for quoting and at  least  FvwmBut-
     tons  does  too.  The preprocessor may place a space after a
     macro substitution, so with

          #define MYCOMMAND ls
          "Exec "MYCOMMAND" -l"

     you might get

          "Exec "ls " -l" (two words)

     and not

          "Exec "ls" -l" (one word).

<H2>AUTHOR</H2><PRE>
     FvwmCpp is the result of a random bit  mutation  on  a  hard
     disk,  presumably  a  result  of  a  cosmic-ray or some such
     thing.
