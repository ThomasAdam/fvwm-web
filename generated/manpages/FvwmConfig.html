<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     FvwmConfig - the FVWM Configuration Aid (Braindead)


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmConfig is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation
     will  work.   From  within  the  .fvwmrc file, FvwmConfig is
     spawned as follows:

     Module FvwmConfig

     or from within an fvwm pop-up menu:

          AddToMenu Module-Popup "Modules" Title
          +         "Configure"      Module FvwmConfig
          +         "FvwmIdentify"   Module FvwmIdent
          +         "Banner"         Module FvwmBanner
          +         "SaveDesktop"    Module FvwmSave




</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The FvwmConfig helps users make very simple,  basic  changes
     to the current fvwm configuration.

     In order for FvwmConfig to  make  changes  which  will  take
     effect for future X sessions, the user's or system's .fvwmrc
     file must end with the line "Read .fvwmrc-config".  FvwmCon-
     fig   will   write   its   configuration  out  to  the  file
     $HOME/.fvwmrc-config, thus minimizing conflicts  with  other
     portions of the user's configuration.

     Since FvwmConfig is used to edit the  user's  configuration,
     it  doesn't  make  much sense for it to be very configurable
     itself. There are no user-specifiable configuration  options
     for FvwmConfig.

     Use of this module is  discouraged,  since  the  options  it
     allows are far less in variety than fvwm itself can allow.

     FvwmConfig will not work as intended  if  ANY  styles  other
     than the default styles are applied to it.
