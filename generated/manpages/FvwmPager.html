       ] ] FvwmPager is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invo-
       cation will work.

       All  desks  with  desk numbers between <font color="yellow">first</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">last</font color="yellow">
       <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow"> are displayed. If <font color="yellow">last</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow"> is omitted only the <font color="yellow">first</font color="yellow">
       <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow"> is shown.  If both desk numbers are omitted, the cur-
       rent desk is used instead. If you use an asterisk  '*'  in
       place of <font color="yellow">first</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow"> the pager will always show the current
       desktop, even when you switch desks.

       Example lines to put in your .fvwm2rc:


       Module FvwmPager 0 3

       or

       Module FvwmPager *

       or from within an fvwm pop-up menu:

       AddToMenu Module-Popup Modules Title
       + Audio        Module FvwmAudio
       + Auto         Module FvwmAuto 200

       or

       + Pager        Module FvwmPager *


       If the pager is started with the  <font color="yellow">-transient</font color="yellow">  option,  the
       next  time  a button is released the pager is closed. Note
       that this option does only work if the window style of the
       pager  window is 'sticky' (see fvwm2 man page). You should
       use the 'StaysOnTop' style too.

       Example:


       Style FvwmPager Sticky, StaysOnTop
       *FvwmPager: Rows       1
       *FvwmPager: Columns    1
       Mouse 3 R C Module FvwmPager -transient
       ton 3 in the root window the pager pops up under the mouse
       and while the viewport moves with the mouse.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The FvwmPager module shows a miniature view  of  the  Fvwm
       desktops  which are specified in the command line. This is
       a useful reminder of where your active windows  are.  Win-
       dows  in  the  pager  are shown in the same color as their
       fvwm decorations.

       The pager can be used to change  your  viewport  into  the
       current  desktop,  to  change desktops, or to move windows
       around.

       Pressing mouse button 1 in the pager will cause you  view-
       port  to change to the selected page of the selected desk.
       If you click with button 1 in  the  desk-label  area,  you
       will switch desks but not pages within the desk.

       Dragging  mouse  button  2 on a miniature view of a window
       will cause that window to be move to  the  location  where
       you  release  the mouse button, but your viewport will not
       change. If you drag the window out of the pager  and  onto
       your  desktop, a full size image of the window will appear
       for you to place. There is no way to pick up a  full  size
       image  of  the window and move it into the pager, however.
       Since some mice do not have button 2, I have  made  provi-
       sions to drag windows in the pager by using pressing modi-
       fier-1 (usually Alt) and dragging with button 3.

       Clicking mouse button 3 on a location will cause the view-
       port  to move to the selected location and switch desks if
       necessary, but will not  align  the  viewport  to  a  page
       boundary.  Dragging  button  3  will cause the viewport to
       move as you drag but not  switch  desktops,  even  if  the
       pointer moves to another desktop.

       With  the  <font color="yellow">*FvwmPager:</font color="yellow">  <font color="yellow">SloppyFocus</font color="yellow">  option  the  focus is
       transfered to the window pointed at with  the  mouse  when
       the pointer is inside the pager.

       When  iconified, the pager will work as a fully functional
       current page only pager.  Windows  and  viewports  can  be
       moved  within  the  icon  of the pager. Users will want to
       make sure that they have no lines similar to

       Icon "Fvwm Pager" whatever

       in their .fvwmrc files.

       The FvwmPager program, and  the  concept  for  interfacing
       this  module  to the Window Manager, are all original work
       by Robert Nation.

</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
       During initialization, <font color="yellow">FvwmPager</font color="yellow"> will eventually search  a
       configuration  file  which  describes  the  time-outs  and
       actions to take.  The configuration file is the same  file
       that fvwm used during initialization.

       To  use  FvwmPager  with several different configurations,
       you can invoke FvwmPager with an optional parameter, which
       it  will  use  as  its <font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow"> instead (e.g "Module FvwmPager
       OtherPager").  OtherPager will then read only the lines in
       the  configuration  file  starting with "*OtherPager", and
       not the lines belonging to FvwmPager.  This  way  multiple
       pager instances may be used.

       Note:  the  old way to use the FvwmPager with several dif-
       ferent configurations is to link the executable to another
       name, i.e.

       ln -s FvwmPager OtherPager

       This may work, but this method is not supported.



</PRE>
<H2>KEYBOARD FOCUS CONTROL</H2><PRE>
       You  can  direct  the  keyboard focus to any window on the
       current desktop by clicking with button 2 on its image  in
       the  pager. The window does not need to be visible, but it
       does need to be on the current page.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       The invocation method was shown in the synopsis section



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmPager reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm  reads  when
       it starts up, and looks for certain configuration options:


       *FvwmPager: Geometry <font color="yellow">geometry</font color="yellow">
              In order to maintain an undistorted  aspect  ratio,
              you  might  want  to  leave out either the width or
              height dimension of the geometry specification


       *FvwmPager: Rows <font color="yellow">rows</font color="yellow">
              Tells fvwm how many rows of desks to use when  lay-
              ing out the pager window.


       *FvwmPager: Columns <font color="yellow">columns</font color="yellow">
              Tells  fvwm  how  many columns of desks to use when
              laying out the pager window.


       *FvwmPager: IconGeometry <font color="yellow">geometry</font color="yellow">
              Specifies a size (optional) and location (optional)
              for the pager's icon window. Since there is no easy
              way for FvwmPager to determine the  height  of  the
              icon's  label,  you  will have to make an allowance
              for the icon  label height when using  negative  y-
              coordinates  in  the  icon  location  specification
              (used to specify a location relative to the  bottom
              instead of the top of the screen).


       *FvwmPager: StartIconic
              Causes the pager to start iconified.


       *FvwmPager: NoStartIconic
              Causes  the  pager  to  start normally.  Useful for
              canceling the effect of the <font color="yellow">StartIconic</font color="yellow"> option.


       *FvwmPager: LabelsBelow
              Causes the pager to draw desk labels below the cor-
              responding desk.


       *FvwmPager: LabelsAbove
              Causes the pager to draw desk labels above the cor-
              responding desk.  Useful for canceling  the  effect
              of the <font color="yellow">LabelsBelow</font color="yellow"> option.


       *FvwmPager: ShapeLabels
              Causes  the pager to hide the labels of all but the
              current desk. This turns off label hilighting.


       *FvwmPager: NoShapeLabels
              <font color="yellow">ShapeLabels</font color="yellow"> option.


       *FvwmPager: Font <font color="yellow">font-name</font color="yellow">
              Specified a font to use to label the desktops.   If
              <font color="yellow">font</font color="yellow"><font color="cyan">_</font color="cyan"><font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow">  is "none" then no desktop labels will be
              displayed.


       *FvwmPager: SmallFont <font color="yellow">font-name</font color="yellow">
              Specified a font to use to label the  window  names
              in  the  pager. If not specified, the window labels
              will be omitted. Window labels seem  to  be  fairly
              useless  for  desktop  scales of 32 or greater.  If
              <font color="yellow">font</font color="yellow"><font color="cyan">_</font color="cyan"><font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow"> is "none" then no window  names  will  be
              displayed.


       *FvwmPager: Fore <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
              Specifies  the  color  to  use to write the desktop
              labels, and to draw the page-grid lines.


       *FvwmPager: Back <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
              Specifies the background color for the window.


       *FvwmPager: Hilight <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
              The active page and desk label will be  highlighted
              by  using  this  background  pattern instead of the
              normal background.


       *FvwmPager: HilightPixmap <font color="yellow">pixmap</font color="yellow">
              The active page will be highlighted by  using  this
              background  pattern  instead  of  the  normal back-
              ground.


       *FvwmPager: DeskHilight
              Hilight the active page with  the  current  hilight
              color/pixmap.  Useful  for  canceling the effect of
              the <font color="yellow">NoDeskHilight</font color="yellow"> option.


       *FvwmPager: NoDeskHilight
              Don't hilight the active page.


       *FvwmPager: WindowColors <font color="yellow">fore</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">back</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">hiFore</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">hiBack</font color="yellow">
              Change the normal/highlight colors of the  windows.
              <font color="yellow">fore</font color="yellow">  and <font color="yellow">hiFore</font color="yellow"> specify the colors as used for the


       *FvwmPager: WindowLabelFormat <font color="yellow">format</font color="yellow">
              This  specifies  a  printf()  like  format  for the
              labels in the mini window.  Possible flags are: %t,
              %i, %c, and %r for the window's title, icon, class,
              or resource name,  respectively.   The  default  is
              "%i".


       *FvwmPager: Label <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">label</font color="yellow">
              Assigns the text <font color="yellow">label</font color="yellow"> to desk <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow"> (or the current
              desk if desk is "*") in the  pager  window.  Useful
              for assigning symbolic names to desktops, i.e.

              *FvwmPager: Label 1 Mail
              *FvwmPager: Label 2 Maker
              *FvwmPager: Label * Matlab



       *FvwmPager: DeskColor <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
              Assigns  the  color <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow"> to desk <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow"> (or the cur-
              rent desk if desk is "*") in the pager window. This
              replaces  the  background  color for the particular
              <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow">.  This only  works  when  the  pager  is  full
              sized.   When  Iconified,  the pager uses the color
              specified by *FvwmPager: Back.

              <font color="cyan">TIP:</font color="cyan"> Try using *FvwmPager: DeskColor in conjunction
              with  FvwmCpp  (or FvwmM4) and FvwmBacker to assign
              identical colors to your various desktops  and  the
              pager representations.


       *FvwmPager: Pixmap <font color="yellow">pixmap</font color="yellow">
              Use <font color="yellow">pixmap</font color="yellow"> as background for the pager.


       *FvwmPager: DeskPixmap <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">pixmap</font color="yellow">
              Assigns  the pixmap <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow"> to desk <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow"> (or the cur-
              rent desk if desk is "*") in the pager window. This
              replaces  the  background pixmap for the particular
              <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow">.

              <font color="cyan">TIP:</font color="cyan"> Try using *FvwmPager: DeskPixmap  in  conjunc-
              tion  with  FvwmCpp  (or  FvwmM4) and FvwmBacker to
              assign identical pixmaps to your  various  desktops
              and the pager representations.


       *FvwmPager: DeskTopScale <font color="yellow">number</font color="yellow">
              size.  Things  in  the  pager  window  are shown at
              1/<font color="yellow">number</font color="yellow"> of the actual size.


       *FvwmPager: MiniIcons
              Allow the pager to display a window's mini icon  in
              the  pager,  if  it has one, instead of showing the
              window's name.


       *FvwmPager: MoveThreshold <font color="yellow">pixels</font color="yellow">
              Defines the distance the pointer has  to  be  moved
              before  a  window  being  dragged  with button 2 is
              actually moved. The default value is three  pixels.
              If the pointer moved less that this amount the win-
              dow snaps back to its original  position  when  the
              button is released. If <font color="yellow">pixels</font color="yellow"> is less than zero the
              default value is  used.  The  value  set  with  the
              <font color="yellow">MoveThreshold</font color="yellow"> command in fvwm is inherited by Fvwm-
              Pager but can be overridden with this option.


       *FvwmPager: SloppyFocus
              If the SloppyFocus option is used, you do not  need
              to  click into the mini window in the pager to give
              the real window  the  focus.   Simply  putting  the
              pointer over the window inside the pager is enough.


       *FvwmPager: SolidSeparators
              By default the pages of  the  virtual  desktop  are
              separated  by  dashed  lines  in  the pager window.
              This option causes FvwmPager  to  use  solid  lines
              instead.


       *FvwmPager: NoSeparators
              Turns  off  the  lines  separating the pages of the
              virtual desktop.


       *FvwmPager: Balloons [<font color="yellow">type</font color="yellow">]
              Show a  balloon  describing  the  window  when  the
              pointer  is  moved  into a window in the pager. The
              default format (the  window's  icon  name)  can  be
              changed  using  BalloonStringFormat.   If  <font color="yellow">type</font color="yellow">  is
              <font color="yellow">Pager</font color="yellow"> balloons are just shown for  an  un-iconified
              pager;  if <font color="yellow">type</font color="yellow"> is <font color="yellow">Icon</font color="yellow"> balloons are just shown for
              an iconified pager. If <font color="yellow">type</font color="yellow"> is  anything  else  (or
              null) balloons are always shown.


              Specifies the color for text in the balloon window.
              If omitted it defaults to the foreground color  for
              the window being described.


       *FvwmPager: BalloonBack <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
              Specifies the background color for the balloon win-
              dow. If omitted it defaults to the background color
              for the window being described.


       *FvwmPager: BalloonFont <font color="yellow">font-name</font color="yellow">
              Specifies  a  font  to  use  for  the balloon text.
              Defaults to <font color="yellow">fixed</font color="yellow">.


       *FvwmPager: BalloonBorderWidth <font color="yellow">number</font color="yellow">
              Sets the width  of  the  balloon  window's  border.
              Defaults to 1.


       *FvwmPager: BalloonBorderColor <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
              Sets  the  color  of  the  balloon window's border.
              Defaults to black.


       *FvwmPager: BalloonYOffset <font color="yellow">number</font color="yellow">
              The balloon window is positioned to be horizontally
              centered against the pager window it is describing.
              The vertical position may be set as an offset. Neg-
              ative  offsets  of <font color="yellow">-n</font color="yellow"> are placed <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow"> pixels above the
              pager window, positive offsets of <font color="yellow">+n</font color="yellow"> are  placed  <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow">
              pixels  below.  Offsets  of  -1 and 1 represent the
              balloon window close to the original window without
              a  gap.  Offsets  of  0  are not permitted, as this
              would permit direct transit from  pager  window  to
              balloon  window, causing an event loop. Defaults to
              +3. The offset will change sign  automatically,  as
              needed, to keep the balloon on the screen.


       *FvwmPager: BalloonStringFormat format
              The  same as <font color="yellow">*FvwmPager:</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">WindowLabelFormat</font color="yellow">, it just
              specifies the string to display  in  the  balloons.
              The default is "%i".


       *FvwmPager: Colorset <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">colorset</font color="yellow">
              Tells the module to use colorset <font color="yellow">colorset</font color="yellow"> for <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow">.
              If you use an asterisk '*' in place  of  <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow">,  the
              colorset  is used on all desks. Please refer to the
              man page of the FvwmTheme module for details  about

              of  <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow">, the colorset is used on all desks. Please
              refer to the man page of the FvwmTheme  module  for

              Tells  the  module  to  use  colorset  <font color="yellow">colorset</font color="yellow"> for
              hilighting on <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow">.  If you use an asterisk '*'  in
              place  of  <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow">, the colorset is used on all desks.
              Please refer to the man page of the FvwmTheme  mod-
              ule for details about colorsets.

       *FvwmPager: WindowColorsets <font color="yellow">colorset</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">activecolorset</font color="yellow">
              Uses  colorsets in the same way as *FvwmPager: Win-
              dowColors.  Please refer to the  man  page  of  the
              FvwmTheme  module for details about colorsets.  The
              shadow and hilight colors of the colorset are  only
              used for the window borders if the *FvwmPager: Win-
              dow3DBorders is specified too.

       *FvwmPager: WindowBorderWidth <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow">
              Specifies the width of the border drawn around  the
              mini  windows.  This  also sets the minimum size of
              the mini windows to (2 * <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow"> + 1).  The default is 1.

       *FvwmPager: Window3DBorders
              Specifies  that  the  mini windows should have a 3d
              borders based on the mini window  background.  This
              option only works if *FvwmPager: WindowColorsets is
              specified.
