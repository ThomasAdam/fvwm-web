<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     FvwmPager - the FVWM Pager module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmPager is spawned by fvwm, so no command line  invocation
     will  work.   From  within  the  .fvwmrc  file, FvwmPager is
     spawned as follows:

     Module FvwmPager 0 3

     or

     Module FvwmPager * *

     or from within an fvwm pop-up menu:

     AddToMenu Module-Popup "Modules"      Title
     +                      "Audio"        Module FvwmAudio
     +                      "Auto"         Module FvwmAuto 200
     +                      "Buttons"      Module FvwmButtons
     +                      "Ident"        Module FvwmIdent
     +                      "Banner"       Module FvwmBanner
     +                      "Pager"        Module FvwmPager 0 3

     or

     +                      "Pager"        Module FvwmPager * *

     where "0" is the first desktop to show, and "3" is the  last
     and  "*"  is the current dektop.  In the second format (with
     two asterisks) the current desk is  always  visible  in  the
     pager (and it is also the only one).



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The FvwmPager module shows a  miniature  view  of  the  Fvwm
     desktops  which are specified in the command line. This is a
     useful reminder of where your active windows are. Windows in
     the  pager are shown in the same color as their fvwm decora-
     tions.

     The pager can be used  to  change  your  viewport  into  the
     current  desktop,  to  change  desktops,  or to move windows
     around.

     Pressing mouse button 1 in the pager will cause you viewport
     to  change to the selected page of the selected desk. If you
     click with button 1 in the desk-label area, you will  switch
     desks but not pages within the desk.

     Dragging mouse button 2 on a miniature view of a window will
     cause  that  window  to  be  move  to the location where you
     release the mouse button, but your viewport will not change.
     If  you drag the window out of the pager and onto your desk-
     top, a full size image of the window will appear for you  to
     place.  There  is no way to pick up a full size image of the
     window and move it into the pager, however. Since some  mice
     do not have button 2, I have made provisions to drag windows
     in the pager by using pressing modifier-1 (usually Alt)  and
     dragging with button 3.

     Clicking mouse  button  3  on  a  location  will  cause  the
     viewport  to  move to the selected location and switch desks
     if necessary, but will not align  the  viewport  to  a  page
     boundary.  Dragging button 3 will cause the viewport to move
     as you drag but not switch desktops,  even  if  the  pointer
     moves to another desktop.

     When iconified, the pager will work as  a  fully  functional
     current  page only pager. Windows and viewports can be moved
     within the icon of the pager. Users will want to  make  sure
     that they have no lines similar to

     Icon "Fvwm Pager" whatever

     in their .fvwmrc files.

<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>

     module  to  the  Window  Manager,  are  all original work by

</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
     During initialization, <font color="yellow">FvwmPager</font color="yellow"> will  eventually  search  a
     configuration file which describes the time-outs and actions
     to take.  The configuration file is the same file that  fvwm
     used during initialization.

     If the FvwmPager executable is linked to another name, ie ln
     -s  FvwmPager  OtherPager, then another module called Other-
     Pager can be started, with a completely different configura-
     tion   than   FvwmPager,  simply  by  changing  the  keyword
     FvwmPager to OtherPager. This way  multiple  pager  programs
     can be used.


</PRE>
<H2>KEYBOARD FOCUS CONTROL</H2><PRE>
     You can direct the keyboard  focus  to  any  window  on  the
     current  desktop  by  clicking with button 2 on its image in
     the pager. The window does not need to be  visible,  but  it
     does need to be on the current page.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
     The invocation method was shown in the synopsis section



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmPager reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads when  it
     starts up, and looks for certain configuration options:


     *FvwmPagerGeometry <font color="yellow">geometry</font color="yellow">
          Completely or partially  specifies  the  pager  windows
          location  and  geometry,  in  standard X11 notation. In
          order to maintain  an  undistorted  aspect  ratio,  you
          might  want  to  leave  out  either the width or height
          dimension of the geometry specification


     *FvwmPagerRows <font color="yellow">rows</font color="yellow">
          Tells fvwm how many rows of desks to  use  when  laying
          out the pager window.


     *FvwmPagerColumns <font color="yellow">columns</font color="yellow">
          Tells fvwm how many columnss of desks to use when  lay-
          ing out the pager window.


     *FvwmPagerIconGeometry <font color="yellow">geometry</font color="yellow">
          Specifies a size (optional) and location (optional) for
          the pager's icon window. Since there is no easy way for
          FvwmPager to determine the height of the icon's  label,
          you  will have to make an allowance for the icon  label
          height when using negative y-coordinates  in  the  icon
          location  specification  (used  to  specify  a location
          relative to the  bottom  instead  of  the  top  of  the
          screen).


     *FvwmPagerStartIconic
          Causes the pager to start iconified.


     *FvwmPagerNoStartIconic
          Causes the pager to start normally.  Useful for cancel-
          ling the effect of the <font color="yellow">StartIconic</font color="yellow"> option.

     *FvwmPagerFont <font color="yellow">font</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow">
          Specified a font to use  to  label  the  desktops.   If
          <font color="yellow">font</font color="yellow">_<font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow">  is  "none"  then  no  desktop labels will be
          displayed.


     *FvwmPagerSmallFont <font color="yellow">font</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow">
          Specified a font to use to label the  window  names  in
          the  pager. If not specified, the window labels will be
          omitted. Window labels seem to be  fairly  useless  for
          desktop  scales  of  32  or  greater.   If <font color="yellow">font</font color="yellow">_<font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow"> is
          "none" then no window names will be displayed.


     *FvwmPagerFore <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the color to use to write the desktop labels,
          and to draw the page-grid lines.


     *FvwmPagerBack <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the background color for the window.


     *FvwmPagerHilight <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          The active page and desk label will be  highlighted  by
          using  this  background  pattern  instead of the normal
          background.


     *FvwmPagerWindowColors <font color="yellow">fore</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">back</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">hiFore</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">hiBack</font color="yellow">
          Change the normal/highlight colors of the windows. <font color="yellow">fore</font color="yellow">
          and  <font color="yellow">hiFore</font color="yellow">  specify  the  colors  as used for the font
          inside the windows.  <font color="yellow">back</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">hiBack</font color="yellow"> are used  to  fill
          the windows with.

     *FvwmPagerLabel <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">label</font color="yellow">
          Assigns the text <font color="yellow">label</font color="yellow"> to desk  <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow">  (or  the  current
          desk  if  desk  is "*") in the pager window. Useful for
          assigning symbolic names to desktops, i.e.

          *FvwmPagerLabel 1 Mail
          *FvwmPagerLabel 2 Maker
          *FvwmPagerLabel * Matlab



     *FvwmPagerDeskColor <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Assigns the color <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow"> to desk <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow">  (or  the  current
          desk if desk is "*") in the pager window. This replaces
          the background color for  the  particular  <font color="yellow">desk</font color="yellow">.   This
          only  works  when the pager is full sized.  When Iconi-
          fied,  the  pager   uses   the   color   specified   by
          *FvwmPagerBack.

          <font color="cyan">TIP:</font color="cyan"> Try using *FvwmPagerDeskColor in conjunction  with
          FvwmCpp  (or FvwmM4) and FvwmBacker to assign identical
          colors to your various desktops and the pager represen-
          tations.


     *FvwmPagerDeskTopScale <font color="yellow">number</font color="yellow">
          If the geometry is not specified, then a desktop reduc-
          tion  factor  is  used  to  calculate the pager's size.
          Things in the pager window are shown at 1/<font color="yellow">number</font color="yellow"> of the
          actual size.


     *FvwmPagerMiniIcons
          Allow the pager to display a window's mini icon in  the
          pager,  if  it has one, instead of showing the window's
          name.


     *FvwmPagerBalloons [<font color="yellow">type</font color="yellow">]
          Show a balloon describing the window when  the  pointer
          is moved into a window in the pager. Currently only the
          window's icon name is shown.  If <font color="yellow">type</font color="yellow"> is <font color="yellow">Pager</font color="yellow"> balloons
          are  just  shown  for  an uniconified pager; if <font color="yellow">type</font color="yellow"> is
          <font color="yellow">Icon</font color="yellow"> balloons are just shown for an iconified pager. If
          <font color="yellow">type</font color="yellow">  is  anything  else  (or null) balloons are always
          shown.


     *FvwmPagerBalloonFore <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the color for text in the balloon window.  If
          omitted  it  defaults  to  the foreground color for the
          window being described.


     *FvwmPagerBalloonBack <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the background color for the balloon  window.
          If  omitted it defaults to the background color for the
          window being described.


     *FvwmPagerBalloonFont <font color="yellow">font</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow">
          Specifies a font to use for the balloon text.  Defaults
          to <font color="yellow">fixed</font color="yellow">.


     *FvwmPagerBalloonBorderWidth <font color="yellow">number</font color="yellow">
          Sets the width of the balloon window's border. Defaults
          to 1.

     *FvwmPagerBalloonBorderColor <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Sets the color of the balloon window's border. Defaults
          to black.


     *FvwmPagerBalloonYOffset <font color="yellow">number</font color="yellow">
          The balloon window is  positioned  to  be  horizontally
          centered against the pager window it is describing. The
          vertical position may be set  as  an  offset.  Negative
          offsets  of -<font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow"> are placed <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow"> pixels above the pager win-
          dow, positive offsets of +<font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow"> are placed <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow"> pixels  below.
          Offsets  of  0  are not permitted, as this would permit
          direct transit from pager  window  to  balloon  window,
          causing  an event loop. Defaults to +2. The offset will
          change sign automatically, as needed, to keep the  bal-
          loon on the screen.
