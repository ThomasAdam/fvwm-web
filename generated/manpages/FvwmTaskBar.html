       FvwmTaskBar - the FVWM taskbar module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmTaskBar is spawned by FVWM, so no command line invoca-
       tion will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The FvwmTaskBar module provides a taskbar made up of  but-
       tons arranged by rows, each corresponding to a window that
       FVWM is managing.  Clicking on first button gives focus to
       the corresponding top level window; clicking on the middle
       button will hide a top level window; third mouse button is
       reserved  for a future extension (context menu).  Like the
       other modules, FvwmTaskBar only works when fvwm is used as
       the window manager.

       When started, the taskbar shows up as a single row of but-
       tons filling the full width of the screen, but during  the
       work  can be resized to accommodate up to 8 rows. In addi-
       tion, if the AutoStick option is used,  the  taskbar  will
       auto  position  itself at the top or bottom of the screen,
       and can be dragged from one position  to  another  with  a
       normal move operation.

       The  first button of the taskbar, labelled "Start" sends a
       "Popup StartMenu" command to the FVWM, which can  be  used
       to  pop-up  a  general-purpose  menu  when  the  button is
       pressed.

       The FvwmTaskBar also displays at the right side  a  window
       showing  the  current  time and the built-in incoming mail
       indicator.

       The FvwmTaskBar  module  is  derived  from  Mike  Finger's
       FvwmWinList.

       tees or warranties of any kind about the use of this  mod-

</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
       During   initialization,  <font color="yellow">FvwmTaskBar</font color="yellow">  gets  configuration
       information from FVWM to find the options that pertain  to
       it.  These options are discussed in a later section.


       FvwmTaskBar  can  be invoked by fvwm during initialization
       by inserting the line 'Module FvwmTaskBar' in the .fvwm2rc
       file.

       FvwmTaskBar  must  reside in a directory that is listed in
       the ModulePath option of FVWM for it  to  be  executed  by
       FVWM.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The following options can be placed in the .fvwm2rc file


       *FvwmTaskBar: Geometry <font color="yellow">{+-}&lt;X&gt;{+-}&lt;Y&gt;</font color="yellow">
              Specifies  the  location  and  gravity of the Fvwm-
              TaskBar window.  Currently, this option is  scanned
              as a normal X geometry string.  You can include the
              width and the height in addition to the "x" and "y"
              offset.   However,  only the "x" and "y" offset are
              used.  To avoid possible future compatibility prob-
              lems, only code the "x" and "y" offset.

              The  actual width of the taskbar is always the full
              width of the screen and the height is controlled by
              the *FvwmTaskBar: Rows option.

              If  the  AutoStick option is specified, the taskbar
              automatically "sticks" to the top or the bottom  of
              the  screen,  whichever  is closest to the geometry
              specification.

              To position  the  taskbar  at  the  bottom  of  the
              screen, use a geometry of "+0-0".


       *FvwmTaskBar: Rows r
              Specifies  the  initial number in rows of the Fvwm-
              TaskBar window. Default is 1 and the maximum is  8.


       *FvwmTaskBar: Font <font color="yellow">font</font color="yellow">
              Specifies  the default font to be used for labeling
              the buttons, when they are not  depressed.  If  not
              specified, fixed font is assumed.


       *FvwmTaskBar: SelFont <font color="yellow">font</font color="yellow">
              Specifies  the  font  to  be used for the depressed
              buttons. Note that the Start button will use always
              this font even if is not pressed. If this option is
              not specified, the default font is used instead.

              Specifies the font to be used for the clock and tip
              windows.  If  this  option  is not specified, fixed
              font is used.

              window background and the foreground color  of  the
              buttons.   Please  refer  to  the  man  page of the
              FvwmTheme module for details about colorsets.


       *FvwmTaskBar: IconFore <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
              Specifies the color to use  for  the  button  names
              which represent iconified windows.

              buttons  of iconified windows.  Please refer to the
              man page of the FvwmTheme module for details  about

              Specifies the color to use  for  the  button  which
              represents the window with the focus. If not speci-
              fied the color specified by  *FvwmTaskBar: Back  or
              *FvwmTaskBar:  Colorset is used. Note that the but-
              ton which represents the window with the  focus  is
              also  highlighted.   See "*FvwmTaskBar: NoBrightFo-
              Tells the module to use colorset <font color="yellow">colorset</font color="yellow">  for  the

              Please refer to the man page of the FvwmTheme  mod-
              ule for details about colorsets.


       *FvwmTaskBar: NoBrightFocus
              By  default  the button which represents the window
              with the focus is highlighted. This option disables
              this  feature.   <font color="yellow">Note:</font color="yellow"> uou will want this option if
              you use a pixmap  (via  FvwmTheme)  for  the  back-
              ground.


       *FvwmTaskBar: TipsFore <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">

       *FvwmTaskBar: TipsColorset <font color="yellow">colorset</font color="yellow">
              Tells  the  module to use colorset <font color="yellow">colorset</font color="yellow"> for the
              tips windows.  Please refer to the man page of  the
              FvwmTheme module for details about colorsets.


       *FvwmTaskBar: AutoStick
              This option causes the taskbar to "stick" either to
              the top or bottom of the screen, whichever is clos-
              est  to  the  initial window placement. Any further
              move operation is also subject to that behavior.


       *FvwmTaskBar: AutoFocus
              This option causes the taskbar to raise a window if
              the cursor stays on a button in taskbar and its tip
              is open.


       *FvwmTaskBar: AutoHide
              This option causes the taskbar to disappear leaving
              a  narrow  strip  at  the bottom of the screen, and
              reappear only when  the  mouse  is  moved  to  that
              strip.   This  option  automatically  enables Auto-
              Stick.


       *FvwmTaskBar: UseSkipList
              tion file.


       *FvwmTaskBar: DeskOnly
              Tells FvwmTaskBar to show the windows that are only
              on   the   current   desktop.   When  desktops  are
              switched, the list of windows changes  accordingly.


       *FvwmTaskBar: UseIconNames
              Tells  FvwmTaskBar to use the icon name of the win-
              dow instead of the full window name.  This is  use-
              ful to keep the width of the buttons small.


       *FvwmTaskBar: ShowTransients
              Tells FvwmTaskBar to show the application transient
              windows also. By default they are not shown.


       *FvwmTaskBar: Action <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">response</font color="yellow">
              Tells FvwmTaskBar to do  <font color="yellow">response</font color="yellow">  when  <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow">  is
              done.  The currently supported <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow">s are: Click1,
              Click2, Click3 and so on.  By  default  the  module
              supports 3 mouse buttons, but it can be compiled to
              support more.  The  currently  supported  <font color="yellow">response</font color="yellow">s
              are  any  fvwm built-in commands, including modules
              and functions.  Warning: Use of the  former  syntax
              that  allowed  to use comma separated lists of com-
              mands is strongly discouraged due  to  synchroniza-
              tion  problems  with fvwm.  Please use complex fvwm
              functions instead (defined with the AddToFunc  com-
              mand of fvwm).


       *FvwmTaskBar: ButtonWidth <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow">
              Indicates  the  maximum  width  that window buttons
              should reach.  (the minimum is hard coded at 32).


       *FvwmTaskBar: 3DFvwm
              By default the buttons use a special (asymetric) 3D
              look.  This option enables a more classical 3D look
              (Ie., a la fvwm).


       *FvwmTaskBar: HighlightFocus
              If the mouse pointer is over the taskbar, the  win-
              dow under the current button is active. This behav-
              ior is like the TVTWM Icon Manager or  FvwmIconMan.
              <font color="yellow">Note:</font color="yellow">  If you use this option combined with Follow-
              Mouse focus style, you'll want the  taskbar  to  be
              Enables the tips windows (by default disabled).


       *FvwmTaskBar: NoIconAction <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow">
              Tells  FvwmTaskBar  to  do  <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow"> is when a NoIcon
              style window is iconified or de-iconified. Relevant
              coordinates are appended to <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow"> so that the icon
              can be traced to an FvwmTaskBar button. An  example
              action  is "*FvwmTaskBar: NoIconAction SendToModule
              FvwmAnimate animate". A blank or null action  turns
              this feature off.



       The following options deal more specifically with the sta-
       tus indicators displayed at the right of the taskbar.


       *FvwmTaskBar: ClockFormat <font color="yellow">format-string</font color="yellow">
              This option specifies the time format for the digi-
              tal  clock.   It is a <font color="yellow">strftime(3)</font color="yellow"> compatible format
              string.  By default it is "%R".


       *FvwmTaskBar: UpdateInterval <font color="yellow">seconds</font color="yellow">
              Specifies how often the  clock  display  should  be
              refreshed,  so  that times of the form HH:MM:SS can
              be used. By default 60 seconds.


       *FvwmTaskBar: BellVolume <font color="yellow">volume</font color="yellow">
              This sets the volume  of  the  bell  when  mail  is
              detected.   It  is  a value between 0 (no bell) and
              100 (maximum volume).  By default it is set to  20.


       *FvwmTaskBar: MailBox <font color="yellow">path</font color="yellow">
              This  option  instructs the module to look for mail
              at the specified place It is a full pathname to the
              user's     mailbox.      By     default    it    is
              <font color="yellow">/var/spool/mail/$USER</font color="yellow"><font color="cyan">_</font color="cyan"><font color="yellow">LOGIN</font color="yellow">.   A  value  of  'None'
              instructs  the module not to have a mail indicator.


       *FvwmTaskBar: MailCommand <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">
              Specifies a <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> command to be executed  when  dou-
              ble-clicking on the mail icon.


       *FvwmTaskBar: MailCheck <font color="yellow">seconds</font color="yellow">
              Specifies the interval between checks for new mail.
              The default is ten seconds. A value of zero or less
              If set, draw no bitmap if there is no new mail.



       The  following  options  deal with the Start button at the
       left of the taskbar:


       *FvwmTaskBar: StartName <font color="yellow">string</font color="yellow">
              This option specifies the string displayed  in  the
              Start button.  ('Start' by default).


       *FvwmTaskBar: StartMenu <font color="yellow">string</font color="yellow">
              This  option  specifies  the  pop up menu to invoke
              when the start button is pressed.  ('StartMenu'  by
              default).  The module send a 'Popup StartMenu' com-
              mand to the fvwm window manager.


       *FvwmTaskBar: StartIcon <font color="yellow">icon-name</font color="yellow">
              This option specifies the name of the icon to  dis-
              play at the left of the Start button.
