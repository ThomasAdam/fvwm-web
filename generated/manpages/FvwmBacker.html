<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     FvwmBacker - the FVWM background changer module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmBacker is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation
     will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The FvwmBacker module provides functionality to  change  the
     background  when changing desktops.  Any command can be exe-
     cuted to change the backgrounds.   Actually,  any  arbitrary
     command can be sent to fvwm to execute, so you could also do
     things such as changing window border colors, etc.



</PRE>
<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>
     The FvwmBacker module is the original work of Mike Finger.

     Copyright 1994, Mike Finger. The author makes no  guarantees
     or warranties of any kind about the use of this module.  Use
     this modules at your own risk.   You  may  freely  use  this
     module  or  any portion of it for any purpose as long as the
     copyright is kept intact.



</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
     During initialization, <font color="yellow">FvwmBacker</font color="yellow"> will scan the same  confi-
     guration  file  that  FVWM  used  during startup to find the
     options that pertain to it.  These options are discussed  in
     a later section.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
     FvwmBacker can be invoked by fvwm during  initialization  by
     inserting the line 'Module FvwmBacker' in the .fvwm2rc file.

     FvwmBacker must reside in a directory that is listed in  the
     ModulePath option of FVWM for it to be executed by FVWM.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     The following is the only supported option at present:


     *FvwmBackerDesk <font color="yellow">DeskNumber</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow"> to  execute  when  the  specified
          <font color="yellow">DeskNumber</font color="yellow"> becomes active.

          If the command begins with -<font color="yellow">solid</font color="yellow"> FvwmBacker  uses  the
          next argument as a color in the X database and sets the
          background to that color without  generating  a  system
          call  to  xsetroot (only single word color names may be
          used).  Otherwise the command is sent to fvwm  to  exe-
          cute.



</PRE>
<H2>SAMPLE CONFIGURATION</H2><PRE>
     The following  are  excepts  from  an  .fvwm2rc  file  which
     describe FvwmBacker initialization commands:


     ####
     # Set Up Backgrounds for different desktops.
     ####
     *FvwmBackerDesk 0 -solid steelblue
     *FvwmBackerDesk 1 -solid midnightblue
     *FvwmBackerDesk 2 -solid yellow
     *FvwmBackerDesk 3 Exec xpmroot /usr/include/X11/pixmaps/background2.xpm
