<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     FvwmScroll - the FVWM scroll-bar module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmScroll is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation
     will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The FvwmScroll module prompts the user to  select  a  target
     window,  if the module was not launched from within a window
     context in Fvwm.  After that, it adds  scroll  bars  to  the
     selected  window, to reduce the total desktop space consumed
     by the window.


     FvwmScroll reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads when it
     starts  up,  and looks for lines similar to "*FvwmScrollFore
     green".

     FvwmScroll should not be used with  windows  which  move  or
     resize  themselves, nor should it be used with windows which
     set the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property. Operation is fine with
     windows that have a private colormap.



</PRE>
<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>
     The FvwmScroll program, and the concept for interfacing this
     module  to  the  Window  Manager,  are  all original work by
     Robert Nation.

     Copyright 1994, Robert Nation. No guarantees  or  warranties
     or  anything  are provided or implied in any way whatsoever.
     Use this program at your own risk. Permission  to  use  this
     program  for  any purpose is given, as long as the copyright
     is kept intact.




</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
     During initialization, <font color="yellow">FvwmScroll</font color="yellow"> will eventually  search  a
     configuration  file  which describes the colors to use.  The
     configuration file is the same file that  fvwm  used  during
     initialization.

     If the FvwmScroll executable is linked to another  name,  ie
     ln  -s  FvwmScroll  MoreScroll,  then  another module called
     MoreScroll can be started, with a completely different  con-
     figuration  than  FvwmScroll, simply by changing the keyword
     FvwmScroll to MoreScroll.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
     FvwmScroll can be invoked  by  binding  the  action  'Module
     FvwmScroll x y' to a menu or key-stroke in the .fvwmrc file.
     The parameter x and y are integers, which describe the  hor-
     izontal  and  vertical  window  size  reduction.   Fvwm will
     search directory specified in the  ModulePath  configuration
     option  to  attempt  to  locate FvwmScroll. Although nothing
     keeps you from launching FvwmScroll at  start-up  time,  you
     probably don't want to.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmScroll reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads when it
     starts up, and looks for lines as listed below:


     *FvwmScrollFore <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Tells the module to  use  <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">  instead  of  grey  for
          scroll bars themselves.


     *FvwmScrollBack <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Tells the module to use <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow"> instead of black for  the
          window background.



</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     When the scroll bars are removed by clicking on  the  button
     in  the  lower right corner, the window does not restore its
     location correctly.
