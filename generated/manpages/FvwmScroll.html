       FvwmScroll - the FVWM scroll-bar module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmScroll  is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invoca-
       tion will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The FvwmScroll module prompts the user to select a  target
       window,  if the module was not launched from within a win-
       dow context in Fvwm.  After that, it adds scroll  bars  to
       the  selected  window,  to  reduce the total desktop space
       consumed by the window.


       FvwmScroll reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads  when
       it starts up, and looks for lines similar to "*FvwmScroll:
       Back green".

       FvwmScroll should not be used with windows which  move  or
       resize  themselves,  nor  should  it  be used with windows
       which set the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property.  Operation  is
       fine with windows that have a private colormap.



</PRE>
<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>
       The  FvwmScroll  program,  and the concept for interfacing
       this module to the Window Manager, are all  original  work
       by Robert Nation.

       Copyright 1994, Robert Nation. No guarantees or warranties
       or anything are provided or implied in any way whatsoever.
       Use  this program at your own risk. Permission to use this
       program for any purpose is given, as long as the copyright
       is kept intact.




</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
       During initialization, <font color="yellow">FvwmScroll</font color="yellow"> will eventually search a
       configuration file which describes the colors to use.  The
       configuration  file is the same file that fvwm used during
       initialization.

       If the FvwmScroll executable is linked to another name, ie
       ln  -s  FvwmScroll  MoreScroll, then another module called
       MoreScroll can be started,  with  a  completely  different
       configuration than FvwmScroll, simply by changing the key-
       word  FvwmScroll to MoreScroll.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       file.  The parameter x and y are either integers or  inte-
       gers immediately followed by a p, which describe the hori-
       zontal and vertical size modification of the  window.   An
       integer  describe a size reduction. An integer followed by
       a p describe a size as a percentage of the height  or  the
       width  of  a full screen but the size is never larger than
       the original window size (0p will do nothing).  Fvwm  will
       search directory specified in the ModulePath configuration
       option to attempt to locate FvwmScroll.  Although  nothing
       keeps  you from launching FvwmScroll at start-up time, you
       probably don't want to.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmScroll reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads  when
       it starts up, and looks for lines as listed below:


       *FvwmScroll: Colorset <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow">
              Tells  the module to use colorset <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow">. See FvwmTheme.


       *FvwmScroll: Back <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
              Tells the module to use <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow"> instead of black  for
              the  window  background.  Switches off the Colorset
              option.



</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       When the scroll bars are removed by clicking on the button
       in the lower right corner, the window does not restore its
       location correctly.
