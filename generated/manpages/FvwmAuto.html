       <font color="yellow">FvwmAuto</font color="yellow"> - the FVWM auto-raise module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <font color="yellow">FvwmAuto</font color="yellow"> is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation
       will work.  The correct syntax is:

            Module FvwmAuto Timeout [EnterCommand [LeaveCommand]]

            AddToMenu Modules
            + "Auto Raise (300 ms)"  Module FvwmAuto 300
            + "Auto Raise/Lower"     Module FvwmAuto 300 "Silent Raise" "Silent Lower"

       The <font color="yellow">Timeout</font color="yellow"> argument is required. It specifies how long  a
       window  must  retain  the  keyboard input focus before the
       command is executed. The delay is  measured  in  millisec-
       onds, and any integer 0 or greater is acceptable.

       <font color="yellow">EnterCommand</font color="yellow">  and <font color="yellow">LeaveCommand</font color="yellow"> are optional.  <font color="yellow">EnterCommand</font color="yellow">
       is executed <font color="yellow">Timeout</font color="yellow"> milliseconds after a window  gets  the
       input focus, <font color="yellow">LeaveCommand</font color="yellow"> is executed <font color="yellow">Timeout</font color="yellow"> milliseconds
       after the window has lost focus.   Note  that  you  always
       should use the 'Silent' keyword before the command itself.
       FvwmAuto prepends "Silent " to the command string  on  its
       own  if  yor  forget this.  Without this prefix fvwm would
       ask you for a window to act on  if  the  window  has  died
       before  the command sent by FvwmAuto has been processed by
       fvwm.  This can for example happen with popup menus.

       "Silent Raise" is the default for  <font color="yellow">EnterCommand</font color="yellow">,  but  any
       fvwm  function  is  allowed.  I  would  not use "Close" or
       "Destroy" with a low timeout,  though.   The  <font color="yellow">LeaveCommand</font color="yellow">
       can be handy for a tidy desktop.  Experiment with:

            Module FvwmAuto 0 Nop "Silent Lower"
            Module FvwmAuto 0 Nop "Silent Iconify"


       More complex example (three FvwmAuto's are running):

            DestroyFunc RestoreIconified
            AddToFunc   RestoreIconified
            + I Current (Iconic) Iconify false

            DestroyFunc RegisterFocus
            AddToFunc   RegisterFocus
            + I Exec echo "`date +%T` $n focussed" &gt;&gt;/tmp/focus-stats.txt

            DestroyFunc RegisterUnfocus
            AddToFunc   RegisterUnfocus
            + I Exec echo "`date +%T` $n unfocussed" &gt;&gt;/tmp/focus-stats.txt

            KillModule FvwmAuto
            Module FvwmAuto   0 RegisterFocus RegisterUnfocus

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       There is a special Raise/Lower support in FvwmAuto. It was
       added to improve Raise/Lower callbacks, since most of Fvw-
       mAuto   usages  is  auto-raising  or  auto-lowering.  This
       imrovement  includes   locking   on   M_RAISE_WINDOW   and
       M_LOWER_WINDOW    packets    and    not   raising/lowering
       explicitely raised windows.  The special Raise/Lower  sup-
       port is enabled only when either <font color="yellow">EnterCommand</font color="yellow"> or <font color="yellow">LeaveCom-</font color="yellow">
       <font color="yellow">mand</font color="yellow"> contain substring "Raise" or  "Lower".  You  can  use
       this  fact to enable/disable any special support by renam-
       ing these commands, if FvwmAuto does not automatically  do
       want you expect it to do.

       FvwmAuto just appeared one day, nobody knows how.
       FvwmAuto was simply rewritten 09/96, nobody knows by whom.
