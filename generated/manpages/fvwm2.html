<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     fvwm2 - F(?) Virtual Window Manager (version 2.xx) for X11


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <font color="cyan">fvwm</font color="cyan"> [ <font color="yellow">options</font color="yellow"> ]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <font color="yellow">Fvwm</font color="yellow"> is a window manager for X11.  It  is  a  derivative  of
     <font color="yellow">twm</font color="yellow">,  redesigned  to  minimize memory consumption, provide a
     3-D look to window frames,  and  provide  a  simple  virtual
     desktop.   Version  2.xx uses only slightly more memory than
     1.xx, mostly due to some global options  being  able  to  be
     window specific now.

     Fvwm provides both a large virtual desktop and multiple dis-
     joint  desktops  which  can  be used separately or together.
     The virtual desktop allows you to pretend  that  your  video
     screen  is  really  quite  large,  and you can scroll around
     within the desktop.  The multiple  disjoint  desktops  allow
     you  to pretend that you really have several screens to work
     at, but each screen is completely unrelated to the others.

     Fvwm provides keyboard accelerators which allow you to  per-
     form  most  window-manager  functions,  including moving and
     resizing windows, and operating the window-manager's  menus,
     using keyboard shortcuts.

     Fvwm has also blurred the distinction between  configuration
     commands  and  built-in  commands  that most window-managers
     make.  Configuration commands typically set  fonts,  colors,
     menu  contents,  key  and  mouse  function  bindings,  while
     built-in commands typically do things like raise  and  lower
     windows.  Fvwm makes no such distinction, and allows, to the
     extent that is practical, anything  to  be  changed  at  any
     time.

     Other noteworthy differences between Fvwm and other X11 win-
     dow  managers  are  the  introduction of the SloppyFocus and
     per-window focus  methods.   SloppyFocus  is  focus-follows-
     mouse,  but focus is not removed from windows when the mouse
     leaves a window and enters the  root  window.   When  sloppy
     focus is used as the default focus style, it is nice to make
     windows in which you do not typically type into (xmag, xman,
     xgraph,  xclock,  xbiff,  etc)  click-to-focus, so that your
     terminal window doesn't lose focus unnecessarily.

<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>
     Since <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> is derived from <font color="yellow">twm</font color="yellow"> code it  shares  <font color="yellow">twm</font color="yellow">'s  copy-
     rights.   Since  nearly  every  line  of  twm  code has been
     changed, the twm copyright has been removed from most of the
     individual  code  files.  I do still recognize the influence
     of twm code in the overall package, so fvwm's  copyright  is
     still considered to be the same as twm's.

     Please consult the COPYING file that has come with your dis-
     tribution for details.

<H2>ANATOMY OF A WINDOW</H2><PRE>
     <font color="yellow">Fvwm</font color="yellow"> puts a decorative border  around  most  windows.   This
     border consists of a bar on each side and a small "L" shaped
     section on each corner.  There  is  an  additional  top  bar
     called  the  title  bar which is used to display the name of
     the window.  In addition, there are up to 10 title-bar  but-
     tons.  The top, side, and bottom bars are collectively known
     as the side-bars.  The corner pieces are called the frame.

     Unless the standard defaults files  are  modified,  pressing
     mouse  button  1 in the title or side-bars will begin a move
     operation on the window.  Pressing button 1  in  the  corner
     frame pieces will begin a resize operation.  Pressing button
     2 anywhere in the border brings up an extensive list of win-
     dow operations.

     Up to ten title-bar buttons may exist.  Their  use  is  com-
     pletely  user  definable.   The  default configuration has a
     title-bar button on each side of the title-bar.  The one  on
     the  left  is  used  to  bring  up a list of window options,
     regardless of which mouse button is used.  The  one  on  the
     right  is  used to iconify the window.  The number of title-
     bar buttons used depends on which ones  have  mouse  actions
     bound to them.  See the section on the "Mouse" configuration
     parameter below.




</PRE>
<H2>THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP</H2><PRE>
     <font color="yellow">Fvwm</font color="yellow"> provides multiple virtual desktops for users  who  wish
     to  use them.  The screen is a viewport onto a desktop which
     may be larger than the screen.   Several  distinct  desktops
     can  be accessed (concept:  one desktop for each project, or
     one desktop for each application, when view applications are
     distinct).  Since each desktop can be larger than the physi-
     cal screen, divided into m by n pages  which  are  each  the
     size  of  the physical screen, windows which are larger than
     the screen or large groups of related windows can easily  be
     viewed.

     The (m by n) size (i.e. number  of  pages)  of  the  virtual
     desktops  can  be changed any time, by using the DeskTopSize
     built-in command.  All virtual desktops must  be  (are)  the
     same  size.   The total number of distinct desktops need not
     be specified, but is  limited  to  approximately  4  billion
     total.   All windows on a range of desktops can be viewed in
     the Pager, a miniature view of the desktops.  The  pager  is
     an  accessory  program, called a module, which is not essen-
     tial for the window manager to operate.  Windows may also be
     listed,  along  with  their  geometries,  in  a window list,
     accessible as a pop-up menu, or as a separate window, called
     the FvwmWinList (another module).

     "Sticky" windows are windows  which  transcend  the  virtual
     desktop  by  "Sticking  to the screen's glass."  They always
     stay put on the screen.  This is convenient for things  like
     clocks  and xbiff's, so you only need to run one such gadget
     and it always stays with you.  Icons can  also  be  made  to
     stick to the glass, if desired.

     Window geometries are  specified  relative  to  the  current
     viewport.  That is:

          xterm -geometry +0+0

     will always show up in the upper-left  hand  corner  of  the
     visible portion of the screen.  It is permissible to specify
     geometries which place windows on the virtual  desktop,  but
     off  the screen.  For example, if the visible screen is 1000
     by 1000 pixels, and the desktop size is 3x3, and the current
     viewport  is  at  the upper left hand corner of the desktop,
     then invoking:

          xterm -geometry +1000+1000

     will place the window just  off  of  the  lower  right  hand
     corner  of  the screen.  It can be found by moving the mouse
     to the lower right hand corner of the screen and waiting for
     it to scroll into view.

     A geometry specified as something like:

          xterm -geometry -5-5

     will generally place the window's lower right hand corner  5
     pixels from the lower right corner of the visible portion of
     the screen. Not all applications support  window  geometries
     with  negative  offsets.  Some will place the window's upper
     right hand corner 5 pixels above and  to  the  left  of  the
     upper  left  hand  corner  of the screen; others may do just
     plain bizarre things.


     There are several ways to cause a window to map onto a desk-
     top  or  page  other  than  the  currently  active  one. The
     geometry technique mentioned above (specifying  x,y  coordi-
     nates  larger  than  the  physical  screen  size),  however,
     suffers from the limitation of being interpreted relative to
     the  current  viewport:  the  window  will  not consistently
     appear on a specific page,  unless  you  always  invoke  the
     application from the same page.

     A better way to place windows on a different  page  or  desk
     from  the  currently mapped viewport is to use the StartsOn-
     Page style specification (the successor to the older  Start-
     sOnDesk  style) in the .fvwm2 configuration file. The place-
     ment is consistent: it does not depend on your current loca-
     tion on the virtual desktop.

     Some applications that understand standard Xt  command  line
     arguments  and  X  resources, like xterm and xfontsel, allow
     the user to specify the start-up desk or page on the command
     line:

          xterm -xrm "*Desk:1"

     will start an xterm on desk number 1;

          xterm -xrm "*Page:3 2 1"

     will start an xterm two pages to the right and one down from
     the  upper left hand page of desk number 3. Not all applica-
     tions understand the use of these options, however.

     You could achieve the same results with the following  lines
     in your

          XTerm*Desk: 1

     or

          XTerm*Page: 3 2 1

<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
     During initialization, <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> will search for a  configuration
     file  which  describes  key  and  button bindings, and a few
     other things.  The format of these files will  be  described
     later.  First, <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> will search for a file named .fvwm2rc in
     the user's home directory, then in ${sysconfdir}  (typically
     /usr/local/etc).    Failing   that,   it   will   look   for
     system.fvwm2rc in ${sysconfdir}  for  system-wide  defaults.
     If that file is not found, <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> will be basically useless.

     <font color="yellow">Fvwm</font color="yellow"> will set two environment variables which will be inher-
     ited  by  its  children.  These are $DISPLAY which describes
     the display on which  <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">  is  running.   $DISPLAY  may  be
     unix:0.0  or  :0.0,  which doesn't work too well when passed
     through rsh to another machine, so $HOSTDISPLAY will also be
     set and will use a network-ready description of the display.
     $HOSTDISPLAY will always use the TCP/IP  transport  protocol
     (even for a local connection) so $DISPLAY should be used for
     local connections, as it may use Unix-domain sockets,  which
     are faster.

     Fvwm has three special functions for initialization:  Start-
     Function,  which is executed on startups and restarts; Init-
     Function and RestartFunction, which are executed during Ini-
     tialization  and  Restarts  (respectively) just after Start-
     Function.  These may be customized in a user's rc  file  via
     the   AddToFunc  facility  (described  later)  to  start  up
     modules, xterms, or whatever you'd like to have  started  by
     fvwm.

     <font color="yellow">Fvwm</font color="yellow"> also has a special exit  function:  ExitFunction,  exe-
     cuted when exiting or restarting before actually quitting or
     anything else.  It could be used to explicitly kill modules,
     etc.



</PRE>
<H2>COMPILATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     <font color="yellow">Fvwm</font color="yellow"> has a number of compile-time options to  reduce  memory
     usage  by limiting the use of certain features.  If you have
     trouble using a certain command or feature, check to see  if
     support  for  it  was  included  at  compile time.  Optional
     features are described in the config.h file.



</PRE>
<H2>ICONS</H2><PRE>
     The basic <font color="yellow">Fvwm</font color="yellow"> configuration uses monochrome  bitmap  icons,
     similar  to  <font color="yellow">twm</font color="yellow">.   If  XPM extensions are compiled in, then
     color icons similar to ctwm, MS-Windows,  or  the  Macintosh
     icons  can  be used.  In order to use these options you will
     need the XPM package, as described in the INSTALL.fvwm file.

     If both the SHAPE and XPM options are compiled in  you  will
     get shaped color icons, which are very spiffy.



</PRE>
<H2>MODULES</H2><PRE>
     A module is a separate program which runs as a separate Unix
     process  but  transmits  commands to <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> to execute.  Users
     can write their own modules to do any weird or bizarre mani-
     pulations  without  bloating  or  affecting the integrity of
     <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> itself.

     Modules MUST be spawned by <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> so that it can  set  up  two
     pipes  for  <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">  and  the  module to communicate with.  The
     pipes will already be open for the module when it starts and
     the  file  descriptors for the pipes are provided as command
     line arguments.

     Modules can be spawned during <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> at any time during the  X
     session  by use of the Module built-in command.  Modules can
     exist for the duration of the X session, or  can  perform  a
     single  task  and  exit.  If the module is still active when
     <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> is told to quit, then <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> will close the communication
     pipes  and  wait to receive a SIGCHLD from the module, indi-
     cating that it has detected the pipe closure and has exited.
     If  modules  fail  to detect the pipe closure <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> will exit
     after approximately 30 seconds anyway.  The number of simul-
     taneously  executing  modules  is  limited  by the operating
     system's maximum number of simultaneously open  files,  usu-
     ally between 60 and 256.

     Modules simply transmit text commands to the  <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">  built-in
     command  engine.  Text commands are formatted just as in the
     case of a mouse binding in the .fvwm2rc setup file.  Certain
     auxiliary  information is also transmitted, as in the sample
     module FvwmButtons.  The FvwmButtons module is documented in
     its own man page.



</PRE>
<H2>ICCCM COMPLIANCE</H2><PRE>
     <font color="yellow">Fvwm</font color="yellow"> attempts to be ICCCM 1.1 compliant.  In addition, ICCCM
     states  that  it  should  be  possible  for  applications to
     receive ANY keystroke, which is not consistent with the key-
     board  shortcut  approach used in <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> and most other window
     managers. In particular you cannot have  the  same  keyboard
     shortcuts  working with your fvwm2 and another fvwm2 running
     within Xnest (a nested X server). The  same  problem  exists
     with mouse bindings.

     The ICCCM states that windows possessing the property

          WM_HINTS(WM_HINTS):
              Client accepts input or input focus: False

     should not be given the keyboard input focus by  the  window
     manager.   These  windows  can take the input focus by them-
     selves, however.  A number of  applications  set  this  pro-
     perty,  and  yet  expect the window-manager to give them the
     keyboard focus anyway,  so  fvwm  provides  a  window-style,
     "Lenience",  which  will  allow  fvwm to overlook this ICCCM
     rule.




</PRE>
<H2>M4 PREPROCESSING</H2><PRE>
     M4 pre-processing is handled by a module  in  fvwm-2.0.   To
     get  more  details,  try  man FvwmM4.  In short, if you want
     fvwm to parse your files with  m4,  then  replace  the  word
     "Read" with "FvwmM4" in your .fvwm2rc file (if it appears at
     all), and start fvwm with the command

          fvwm -cmd "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc"




</PRE>
<H2>CPP PREPROCESSING</H2><PRE>
     Cpp is the C-language pre-processor.   fvwm-2.0  offers  cpp
     processing which mirrors the m4 pre-processing.  To find out
     about it, re-read the M4 section  above,  but  replace  "m4"
     with "cpp".



</PRE>
<H2>AUTO-RAISE</H2><PRE>
     Windows can be automatically raised when it receives  focus,
     or  some  number of milliseconds after it receives focus, by
     using the auto-raise module, FvwmAuto.



</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     These are the command line options that  are  recognized  by
     <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">:

     <font color="cyan">-blackout</font color="cyan">
          The screen is blacked out during window recaptures  and
          startup. This option is provided for backwards compati-
          bility only.

     <font color="cyan">-cmd</font color="cyan"> <font color="yellow">config</font color="yellow">_<font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">
          Causes <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> to  use  <font color="yellow">config</font color="yellow">_<font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">  instead  of  "Read
          .fvwm2rc" as its initialization command.  (Note that up
          to 10 <font color="cyan">-f</font color="cyan"> and <font color="cyan">-cmd</font color="cyan"> parameters can be given, and they are
          executed in the order specified.)

     <font color="cyan">-d</font color="cyan"> <font color="yellow">displayname</font color="yellow">
          Manage the display called "displayname" instead of  the
          name obtained from the environment variable $DISPLAY.

     <font color="cyan">-debug</font color="cyan">
          Puts X transactions in synchronous mode, which dramati-
          cally  slows  things  down,  but guarantees that <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">'s
          internal error messages are correct.  Also causes  <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">
          to output debug messages while running.

     <font color="cyan">-f</font color="cyan"> <font color="yellow">config</font color="yellow">_<font color="yellow">file</font color="yellow">
          Causes <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> to Read <font color="yellow">config</font color="yellow">_<font color="yellow">file</font color="yellow"> instead  of  ".fvwm2rc"
          as its initialization file.  This is equivalent to <font color="cyan">-cmd</font color="cyan">
          "Read <font color="yellow">config</font color="yellow">_<font color="yellow">file</font color="yellow">".

     <font color="cyan">-h</font color="cyan">   A short usage description is printed.

     <font color="cyan">-s</font color="cyan">   On a multi-screen display, run <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> only on the  screen
          named  in the $DISPLAY environment variable or provided
          through the -d option. Normally, <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> will  attempt  to
          start up on all screens of a multi-screen display.

     <font color="cyan">-version</font color="cyan">
          Print the version of <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> to stderr.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION FILES</H2><PRE>
     The configuration file is used to describe mouse and  button
     bindings,  colors,  the  virtual  display  size, and related
     items.  The initialization configuration file  is  typically
     called ".fvwm2rc".  By using the "Read" built-in, it is easy
     to read in new configuration files as you go.

     Lines beginning with '#' will be  ignored  by  <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">.   Lines
     starting  with '*' are expected to contain module configura-
     tion commands (rather than configuration commands  for  <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">
     itself).

     Fvwm makes no distinction between configuration commands and
     built-in  commands,  so  anything  mentioned in the built-in
     commands section  can be placed on a line by itself for fvwm
     to  execute as it reads the configuration file, or it can be
     placed as an executable command in a  menu  or  bound  to  a
     mouse  button  or a keyboard key.  It is left as an exercise
     for the user to decide which function make  sense  for  ini-
     tialization and which ones make sense for run-time.



</PRE>
<H2>BUILT IN FUNCTIONS</H2><PRE>
     <font color="yellow">Fvwm</font color="yellow"> supports a set of built-in functions which can be bound
     to  keyboard  or  mouse  buttons.  If fvwm expects to find a
     built-in function in a command, but fails, it will check  to
     see  if  the  specified  command  should have been "Function
     (rest of command)" or  "Module  (rest  of  command)".   This
     allows  complex  functions  or  modules  to  be invoked in a
     manner which is  fairly  transparent  to  the  configuration
     file.

     Example: the .fvwm2rc file contains the line "HelpMe".  Fvwm
     will  look  for a built-in command called "HelpMe", and will
     fail. Next it will look for a user-defined complex  function
     called  "HelpMe".   If no such user defined function exists,
     Fvwm will try to execute a module called "HelpMe".

     In previous versions of fvwm, quoting was critical and irra-
     tional  in the .fvwmrc file.  As of fvwm-2, most of this has
     been cleared up.  Quotes are required only  when  needed  to
     make  fvwm  consider  two or more words to be a single argu-
     ment.  Unnecessary quoting is allowed.  If you want a  quote
     character  in  your  text,  you  must escape it by using the
     backslash character.  For example, if you have a pop-up menu
     called   Window-Ops,  then  you  don't  need  quotes:  Popup
     Window-Ops, but if you replace the dash with a  space,  then
     you need quotes: Popup "Window Ops".



     AddButtonStyle <font color="yellow">button</font color="yellow"> [ <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow"> ] [ <font color="yellow">style</font color="yellow"> ] [-- [!]<font color="yellow">flag</font color="yellow"> ...]
          Adds a button style to <font color="yellow">button</font color="yellow">.  <font color="yellow">button</font color="yellow"> can be a  button
          number, or one of "All," "Left," or "Right."  <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow"> can
          be "ActiveUp," "ActiveDown" or "Inactive."  If <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow"> is
          omitted,  then  the  style is added to every state.  If
          the button style and flags are enclosed in parentheses,
          then multiple state definitions can be placed on a sin-
          gle line.  Flags for additional button styles cannot be
          changed after definition.

          Buttons are drawn in the order of definition, beginning
          with  the  most  recent  ButtonStyle, followed by those
          added with AddButtonStyle.  To clear the  button  style
          stack,  change  style  flags,  or  for  descriptions of
          available styles and flags, see  the  ButtonStyle  com-
          mand.  Examples:

               ButtonStyle 1 Pixmap led.xpm -- Top Left
               ButtonStyle 1 ActiveDown HGradient 8 grey \
                 black
               ButtonStyle All --  UseTitleStyle
               AddButtonStyle 1 ActiveUp (Pixmap a.xpm)  \
                 ActiveDown (Pixmap b.xpm -- Top)
               AddButtonStyle 1 Vector 4 50x30@1 70x70@0 \
                 30x70@0 50x30@1

          Initially for this example all button states are set to
          a  pixmap.   The  second  line  replaces the ActiveDown
          state with a gradient (it overrides the pixmap assigned
          to it in the line before, which assigned the same style
          to every state).  Then, the UseTitleStyle flag  is  set
          for  all  buttons, which causes <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> to draw any styles
          set  with  TitleStyle  before  drawing   the   buttons.
          Finally,  AddButtonStyle  is  used  to place additional
          pixmaps for both ActiveUp and ActiveDown states  and  a
          Vector button style is drawn on top of all state.



     AddTitleStyle [ <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow"> ] [ <font color="yellow">style</font color="yellow"> ] [ -- [!]<font color="yellow">flag</font color="yellow"> ... ]
          Adds a title style to the title bar.  <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow">  should  be
          one  of  "ActiveUp,"  "ActiveDown,"  or "Inactive."  If
          <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow"> is omitted, then the  style  is  added  to  every
          state.    If  the  style  and  flags  are  enclosed  in
          parentheses, then multiple  state  definitions  can  be
          placed on a single line.  This command is quite similar
          to the AddButtonStyle command (see above).

          Title bars are drawn in the order of definition, begin-
          ning with the most recent TitleStyle, followed by those
          added with AddTitleStyle.  To  clear  the  title  style
          stack,  change  style flags, or for the descriptions of
          available styles and flags, see the TitleStyle and But-
          tonStyle commands.



     AddToDecor <font color="yellow">decor</font color="yellow">
          Add or divert commands to the  decor  named  <font color="yellow">decor</font color="yellow">.   A
          decor  is  a  name  given  to the set of commands which
          affect button styles, title-bar styles, border  styles,
          hilight  colors,  and  window fonts.  If <font color="yellow">decor</font color="yellow"> does not
          exist it is created; otherwise the  existing  <font color="yellow">decor</font color="yellow">  is
          modified.

          Created decors start out exactly like the default  fvwm
          decor without any style definitions.  A given decor may
          be applied to a set of windows with the UseDecor option
          of the Style command.  Modifying an existing decor will
          affect windows which are currently assigned to it.

          AddToDecor is similar in usage  to  the  AddToMenu  and
          AddToFunc commands, except that menus and functions are
          replaced by  ButtonStyle,  AddButtonStyle,  TitleStyle,
          AddTitleStyle, BorderStyle, HilightColor and WindowFont
          commands.  Decors created with AddToDecor can be  mani-
          pulated  with  ChangeDecor,  DestroyDecor, UpdateDecor,
          and the UseDecor Style option.

          The following example creates a decor and  style,  both
          named  "flatness."   Despite having the same name, they
          are distinct entities:

               AddToDecor flatness
                + ButtonStyle All ActiveUp (-- flat) \
                  Inactive (-- flat)
                + TitleStyle -- flat
                + BorderStyle -- HiddenHandles NoInset
                + HilightColor white navy
               Style "flatness" UseDecor flatness, \
                 Color white/grey40,HandleWidth 4

               Style "xterm" UseStyle flatness

          An existing  window's  decor  may  be  reassigned  with
          ChangeDecor,   or   a   Style  command  followed  by  a
          Recapture.  The decorations of  all  windows  or  of  a
          specific  decor can be updated with UpdateDecor (useful
          after decorations are modified; changing Style  options
          requires  a  Recapture  instead).   A decor can be des-
          troyed with DestroyDecor.



     AddToFunc [ <font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow"> [ <font color="yellow">trigger</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow">] ]
          Begins or add to  a  function  definition.   Here's  an
          example:

               AddToFunc Move-or-Raise "I" Raise
                + "M" Move
                + "D" Lower

          The  function  name  is  Move-or-Raise,  and  could  be
          invoked from a menu or a mouse binding or key binding:

               Mouse 1 TS A Move-or-Raise

          The quoted portion of the function tells what  kind  of
          action  will trigger the command which follows it.  "I"
          stands for Immediate, and is executed as  soon  as  the
          function  is  invoked.  "M" stands for Motion, i.e.  if
          the user starts  moving  the  mouse.   "C"  stands  for
          Click, i.e., if the user presses and releases the mouse
          in a short period  of  time  (ClickTime  milliseconds).
          "D" stands for double-click.  The action "I" will cause
          an action to be performed on the button-press,  if  the
          function  is invoked with prior knowledge of which win-
          dow to act on.

          The special symbols $d, $w and $0 through $9 are avail-
          able in the ComplexFunctions or Macros, or whatever you
          want to call them.  Within a macro, $w is  expanded  to
          the  window-id (expressed in hex, i.e. 0x10023c) of the
          window for  which  the  macro  was  called  and  $d  is
          expanded  to the current desk number. $0 through $9 are
          the arguments to the macro, so if you call

               Key F10 R A Function MailFunction \
                 xmh "-font fixed"

          and MailFunction is


               AddToFunc MailFunction
                + "I" Next ($0) Iconify -1
                + "I" Next ($0) focus
                + "I" None ($0) Exec exec $0 $1

          Then the last line of the function becomes

                + "I" None (xmh) Exec exec xmh -font fixed

          The expansion is performed as the function is executed,
          so you can use the same function with all sorts of dif-
          ferent arguments.  I could use

               Key F11 R A Function MailFunction \
                 zmail "-bg pink"

          in the same .fvwm2rc, if I wanted.  An example of using
          $w is:

               AddToFunc PrintFunction
                + "I" Raise
                + "I" Exec xdpr -id $w

          Note that $$ is expanded to $.



     AddToMenu <font color="yellow">menu</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow"> [ <font color="yellow">menu</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">label</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow"> ]
          Begins or adds to a menu definition.  Typically a  menu
          definition looks like this:

               AddToMenu Utilities "Utilities" Title
                + "Xterm"         Exec  exec xterm -e tcsh
                + "Rxvt"          Exec  exec rxvt
                + "Remote Logins" Popup Remote-Logins
                + "Top"           Exec  exec rxvt -T Top -n \
                                  Top -e top
                + "Calculator"    Exec  exec xcalc
                + "Xman"          Exec  exec xman
                + "Xmag"          Exec  exec xmag
                + "emacs"         Exec  exec xemacs
                + "Mail"          MailFunction \
                                  xmh "-font fixed"
                + ""              Nop
                + "Modules"       Popup Module-Popup
                + ""              Nop
                + "Exit Fvwm"     Popup Quit-Verify

          The menu could be invoked via

               Mouse 1 R A Menu Utilities Nop

          or

               Mouse 1 R A Popup Utilities

          There is no end-of-menu symbol.  Menus do not  have  to
          be defined in a contiguous region of the .fvwm2rc file.
          The quoted portion in the above examples is  the  menu-
          label, which will appear in the menu when the user pops
          it up.  The remaining portion  is  a  built-in  command
          which  should be executed if the user selects that menu
          item.  An empty menu-label ("") and  the  Nop  function
          can be used to insert a separator into the menu.

          Titles can be used within the  menu.  If  you  add  the
          option "top" behind the keyword "Title", the title will
          be added to the top of the menu.  If there was a  title
          already, it is overwritten.


               AddToMenu Utilities "Tools" Title top


          All text up to the first  TAB  in  the  menu  label  is
          aligned to the left side of the menu, all text right of
          the first TAB is aligned to the right side.  All  other
          TABs are replaced by spaces.

          If the menu-label contains an ampersand ('&amp;'), the next
          character  is taken as a hotkey for the menu item. Hot-
          keys are underlined in the label. To get a literal '&amp;',
          insert '&amp;&amp;'.

          If the menu-label contains a sub-string  which  is  set
          off  by  stars,  then  the  text  between  the stars is
          expected to be the name of an xpm-icon  or  bitmap-file
          to  insert  in  the menu.  To get a literal '*', insert
          '**'.For example

                + "Calculator*xcalc.xpm*" Exec exec xcalc

          inserts a menu item labeled "calculator" with a picture
          of a calculator above it.  The following:

                + "*xcalc.xpm*"           Exec exec xcalc

          Omits the "Calculator" label, but leaves the picture.

          If the menu-label contains a sub-string  which  is  set
          off by percent signs, then the text between the percent
          signs is expected to be the  name  of  an  xpm-icon  or
          bitmap-file  to  insert  to the left of the menu label.
          To get a literal '%', insert '%%'. For example

                + "Calculator%xcalc.xpm%" Exec exec xcalc

          inserts a menu item labeled "calculator" with a picture

          of a calculator to the left.  The following:

                + "%xcalc.xpm%"           Exec exec xcalc

          Omits the "Calculator" label, but leaves  the  picture.
          The  pictures  used  with  this feature should be small
          (perhaps 16x16).

          If the menu-name (not the label) contains a  sub-string
          which  is  set  off  by  at  signs ("@"), then the text
          between them is expected to be the name of  an  xpm  or
          bitmap  file to draw along the left side of the menu (a
          "side pixmap"). You  will  probably  want  to  use  the
          SidePic  option  of  the <font color="yellow">MenuStyle</font color="yellow"> command instead.  To
          get a literal '@', insert '@@'.  For example

               AddToMenu "StartMenu@linux-menu.xpm@"

          creates a menu  with  a  picture  in  its  bottom  left
          corner.

          If the menu-name contains also a sub-string set  of  by
          '^'s,  then the text between '^'s is expected to be the
          name a of X11 color and the column containing the  side
          picture  will be colorized with that color. You can set
          this color for a menu style using the SideColor  option
          of the <font color="yellow">MenuStyle</font color="yellow"> command.  To get a literal '^', insert

               AddToMenu "StartMenu@linux-menu.xpm@^blue^"

          creates a menu with a picture in its bottom left corner
          and colorizes with blue the region of the menu contain-
          ing the picture.

          In all the above cases, the name of the resulting  menu
          is  name  specified, stripped of the substrings between
          the various delimiters.



     AnimatedMove <font color="yellow">x</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">y</font color="yellow"> [ <font color="yellow">Warp</font color="yellow"> ]

          Move a window in an animated way. Similar to Move  com-
          mand,  below.   Options  are  the same, except they are
          required, since it doesn't make sense to  have  a  user
          move  the  window  interactively and animatedly. If the
          optional argument <font color="yellow">Warp</font color="yellow">  is  specified  the  pointer  is
          warped with the window.



     Beep As might be expected, this makes the terminal beep.
     BorderStyle [ <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow"> ] [ <font color="yellow">style</font color="yellow"> ] [ -- [!]<font color="yellow">flag</font color="yellow"> ... ]
          Defines a border  style  for  windows.   <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow">  can  be
          either  "Active"  or  "Inactive."  If <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow"> is omitted,
          then the style is set for both states.   If  the  style
          and  flags  are  enclosed in parentheses, then multiple
          state definitions can be specified per line.

          <font color="yellow">style</font color="yellow"> is a subset of the  available  ButtonStyles,  and
          can  only  be  TiledPixmap (uniform pixmaps which match
          the bevel colors work best this way).  If  an  "!"   is
          prefixed  to  any  flag,  flag behavior is negated.  If
          <font color="yellow">style</font color="yellow"> is not  specified,  then  one  can  change  flags
          without resetting the style.

          The "HiddenHandles" flag hides the corner handle divid-
          ing  lines  on windows with handles (this option has no
          effect for NoHandle windows).  By  default,  HiddenHan-
          dles is disabled.

          The  "NoInset"  flag  supplements  HiddenHandles.    If
          given,  the  inner bevel around the window frame is not
          drawn.  If HiddenHandles is not  specified,  this  flag
          has no effect.

          To decorate the active and inactive window borders with
          a textured pixmap, one might specify:

               BorderStyle Active TiledPixmap marble.xpm
               BorderStyle Inactive TiledPixmap granite.xpm
               BorderStyle Active -- HiddenHandles NoInset

          To clear the style for both states:

               BorderStyle Simple

          To clear for a single state:

               BorderStyle Active Simple

          To unset a flag for a given state:

               BorderStyle Inactive -- !NoInset

          Title-bar buttons can inherit the border style with the
          UseBorderStyle flag (see ButtonStyle).



     ButtonStyle <font color="yellow">button</font color="yellow"> [ <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow"> ] [ <font color="yellow">style</font color="yellow"> ] [ -- [!]<font color="yellow">flag</font color="yellow"> ... ]
          Sets the button style for a title-bar  button.   <font color="yellow">button</font color="yellow">
          is  the title-bar button number between 0 and 9, or one
          of  "All,"  "Left,"  "Right,"   or   "Reset."    Button
          numbering  is  described  in  the  Mouse  section  (see
          below).   If  the  style  and  flags  are  enclosed  in
          parentheses,  then  multiple  state  definitions can be
          specified per line.

          <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow"> refers to which button state should be set.  But-
          ton  states  are  defined  as  follows:  "ActiveUp" and
          "ActiveDown" refer to the unpressed and pressed  states
          for  buttons  on  active  windows; while the "Inactive"
          state denotes buttons on inactive windows.

          If <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow"> is ActiveUp,  ActiveDown,  or  Inactive,  that
          particular  button  state is set.  If <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow"> is omitted,
          every state is set.  Specifying a  style  destroys  the
          current style (use AddButtonStyle to avoid this).

          If <font color="yellow">style</font color="yellow"> is omitted, then state-dependent flags can  be
          set for the primary button style without destroying the
          current style.  Examples  (each  line  should  be  con-
          sidered independent):

               ButtonStyle Left -- flat
               ButtonStyle All ActiveUp (-- flat) \
                 Inactive (-- flat)

          The first line sets every state of the left buttons  to
          flat, while the second sets only the ActiveUp and Inac-
          tive states of every button to  flat  (only  flags  are
          changed;   the   buttons'  individual  styles  are  not
          changed).

          If you want to reset all buttons to their defaults:

               ButtonStyle Reset

          To reset the ActiveUp button state of button 1  to  the
          default:

               ButtonStyle 1 ActiveUp Default

          To reset all button states of button 1 to  the  default
          of button number 2:

               ButtonStyle 1 Default 2


          For any given button, multiple state definitions can be
          given  on  one line by enclosing the style and flags in
          parentheses.  If only one definition per line is  given
          the parentheses can be omitted.

          <font color="yellow">flags</font color="yellow">  affect  the  specified  <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow">.   If  an  "!"  is
          prefixed  to  any  <font color="yellow">flag</font color="yellow">,  its behavior is negated.  The
          available state-dependent  flags  for  all  styles  are
          described  here  (the next ButtonStyle entry deals with
          state-independent flags).

          "Raised" causes a raised relief pattern to be drawn.

          "Sunk" causes a sunken relief pattern to be drawn.

          "Flat" inhibits the relief pattern from being drawn.

          "UseTitleStyle" causes the given button state to render
          the  current  title style before rendering the button's
          own styles.  The  Raised,  Flat,  and  Sunk  TitleStyle
          flags are ignored since they are redundant in this con-
          text.

          "UseBorderStyle"  causes  the  button  to  inherit  the
          decorated BorderStyle options.

          Raised, Sunk, and Flat are mutually exclusive, and  can
          be   specified   for   the  initial  ButtonStyle  only.
          UseTitleStyle  and  UseBorderStyle  are  also  mutually
          exclusive  (both  can  be off however).  The default is
          Raised with both UseBorderStyle and UseTitleStyle  left
          unset.

          There is an <font color="cyan">important</font color="cyan"> <font color="cyan">note</font color="cyan"> for  the  ActiveDown  state.
          When  a  button  is  pressed,  the  relief is inverted.
          Because of this, to obtain a  sunken  ActiveDown  state
          you  must  specify  the  opposite of the desired relief
          (i.e. to obtain a  pressed-in  look  which  is  raised,
          specify  Sunk  for  ActiveDown).  This behavior is con-
          sistent, but may seem confusing at first.

          Button styles are classified as  non-destructive,  par-
          tially   destructive,   or   fully  destructive.   Non-
          destructive styles do not affect the image.   Partially
          destructive styles can obscure some or all parts of the
          underlying  image  (i.e.  Pixmap).   Fully  destructive
          styles  obscure the entire underlying image (i.e. Solid
          or one of the  gradient  styles).   Thus,  if  stacking
          styles  with AddButtonStyle (or AddTitleStyle for title
          bars),  use  care  in  sequencing  styles  to  minimize
          redraw.

          The available styles and  their  arguments  now  follow
          (depending  on  compilation options, some button styles
          may be unavailable).

          The "Simple" style does nothing.  There  are  no  argu-
          ments,   and  this  style  is  an  example  of  a  non-
          destructive button style.

          The "Default" style conditionally accepts one argument:
          a  number  which specifies the default button number to
          load.  If the style command  given  is  ButtonStyle  or
          AddButtonStyle,  the  argument  is  optional (if given,
          will override the current button).  If a command  other
          than  ButtonStyle or AddButtonStyle is used, the number
          must be specified.

          The "Solid" style fills the button with a solid  color.
          The  relief  border  color  is not affected.  The color
          should be specified as a single argument.   This  style
          is fully destructive.

          The "Vector" style draws a line pattern.  Since this is
          a  standard  button  style,  the  keyword  "Vector"  is
          optional.  The specification is a little cumbersome:

               ButtonStyle 2 Vector 4 50x30@1 70x70@0 \
                 30x70@0 50x30@1

          then the button 2 decoration will use a 4-point pattern
          consisting of a line from (x=50,y=30) to (70,70) in the
          shadow color (@0), and then to (30,70)  in  the  shadow
          color,  and  finally  to (50,30) in the highlight color
          (@1).  Is that too confusing? See the  sample  .fvwm2rc
          for  a  few examples.  This style is partially destruc-
          tive.

          The "VGradient" and "HGradient" styles denote  gradient
          styles.   The  H  and V prefixes denote both horizontal
          and vertical directions.

          This style has two forms:

            The first form specifies a  linear  gradient.   Argu-
            ments:  total number of colors to allocate (between 2
            and 128), the initial color, and the final color.

            The  second  form  specifies  a  nonlinear  gradient.
            Arguments:   total   number  of  colors  to  allocate
            (between 2 and 128), then  the  number  of  segments.
            For each segment, specify the starting color, percen-
            tage to increment, then ending  color.   Each  subse-
            quent  segment begins with the color of the last seg-
            ment.  All of the percentages must add up to 100.





          Example:

               TitleStyle VGradient 16 3 Red 20 Blue 30 \
                 Black 50 Grey

          The gradient styles are fully destructive.

          The "Pixmap" style displays a pixmap.  A pixmap  should
          be  specified as an argument.  For example, the follow-
          ing would give  button  2  the  same  pixmap  for  both
          states, and button 4 different pixmaps for the up, down
          and inactive states.

               ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap my_pixmap.xpm
               ButtonStyle 4 ActiveUp (Pixmap up.xpm) \
                 ActiveDown (Pixmap down.xpm)
               ButtonStyle 4 Inactive Pixmap inactive.xpm

          The pixmap specification can be given as an absolute or
          relative pathname (see PixmapPath).  If the pixmap can-
          not be found,  the  button  style  reverts  to  Simple.
          Flags specific to the Pixmap style are "Left," "Right,"
          "Top," and "Bottom."  These can be used to justify  the
          pixmap (default is centered for both directions).  Pix-
          map transparency is used for the  color  "None."   This
          style is partially destructive.

          The "MiniIcon" style draws the window's miniature  icon
          in  the  button,  which  is specified with the MiniIcon
          option of the Style command. This button style  accepts
          no arguments.  Example:

               Style "*"     MiniIcon mini-bx2.xpm
               Style "xterm" MiniIcon mini-term.xpm
               Style "Emacs" MiniIcon mini-doc.xpm

               ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon


          The "TiledPixmap" style accepts a pixmap to be tiled as
          the  button  background.  One pixmap is specified as an
          argument.  Pixmap transparency is not used.  This style
          is fully destructive.



     ButtonStyle <font color="yellow">button</font color="yellow"> - [!]<font color="yellow">flag</font color="yellow"> ...
          Sets state-independent flags for the specified  <font color="yellow">button</font color="yellow">.
          State-independent  flags  affect button behavior.  Each
          flag is separated by a space.  If an "!" is prefixed to
          the  flag  then the flag behavior is negated.  The spe-
          cial flag "Clear" clears any existing flags.
          The following flags are usually used to tell fvwm which
          buttons should be affected by MWM function hints.  This
          is not done automatically since you might have  buttons
          bound to complex functions, for instance.

          "MWMDecorMenu" should be assigned to title bar  buttons
          which  display  a  menu.  The default assignment is the
          leftmost button.  When a window with  the  MWMFunctions
          Style  option requests not to show this button, it will
          be hidden.

          "MWMDecorMin" should be assigned to title  bar  buttons
          which  minimize  or  iconify  the  window.  The default
          assignment is the second button over from the rightmost
          button.   When  a  window  with  the MWMFunctions Style
          option requests not to show this  button,  it  will  be
          hidden.

          "MWMDecorMax" should be assigned to title  bar  buttons
          which  maximize  the window.  The default assignment is
          the rightmost button.  When a window with the  MWMFunc-
          tions Style option requests not to show this button, it
          will be hidden.



     ChangeDecor <font color="yellow">decor</font color="yellow">
          Changes the decor of  a  window  to  <font color="yellow">decor</font color="yellow">.   <font color="yellow">decor</font color="yellow">  is
          "Default,"  or  the name of a decor defined with AddTo-
          Decor.  If <font color="yellow">decor</font color="yellow"> is invalid, nothing occurs.  If called
          from  somewhere  in  a  window or its border, then that
          window is affected.  If called from the root window the
          user  will  be  allowed  to  select  the target window.
          ChangeDecor only affects attributes which  can  be  set
          using the AddToDecor command.

               ChangeDecor "CustomDecor1"



     ChangeMenuStyle <font color="yellow">menustyle</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">menu</font color="yellow"> ...
          Changes the menu style of "menu"  to  "menustyle",  you
          may  specified  more than one menu in each <font color="yellow">ChangeMenuS-</font color="yellow">
          <font color="yellow">tyle</font color="yellow">.

               ChangeMenuStyle  pixmap1 Screensavers ScreenLock



     ClickTime [ <font color="yellow">delay</font color="yellow"> ]
          Specifies the maximum delay (in milliseconds) between a
          button  press  and  a  button  release for the Function
          built-in to consider the action  a  mouse  click.   The
          default  delay is 150 milliseconds.  Omitting the delay
          value resets the ClickTime to the default.



     Close
          If the window accepts the delete window protocol a mes-
          sage  is  sent  to  the  window asking it to gracefully
          remove itself.  If the window does not  understand  the
          delete window protocol then the window is destroyed.



     ColorLimit <font color="yellow">limit</font color="yellow">
          Specifies a limit  on the colors used in  pixmaps  used
          by  fvwm.   Zero  (the    default)   sets no     limit.
          Fvwm uses  pixmaps  for  icons, mini-icons, and  pixmap
          borders  and titles.  This command limits pixmap colors
          to a set  of  colors  that   starts  out  with   common
          colors.   The  current   list  contains about 60 colors
          and  starts with white, black,  grey,    green,   blue,
          red,   cyan,   yellow,   and    magenta.   The  command
          "ColorLimit 9" would limit pixmaps to these 9 colors.

          It makes the most sense to  put  this  command  at  the
          front of the definitions that contain mini-icons.

          Solid frame and title  colors  (including  shadows  and
          gradients) are not controlled by this command.



     ColormapFocus <font color="yellow">FollowsMouse</font color="yellow">|<font color="yellow">FollowsFocus</font color="yellow">
          By default, fvwm installs the colormap  of  the  window
          that  the  cursor is in.  If you use ColormapFocus Fol-
          lowsFocus, then the installed colormap will be the  one
          for the window that currently has the keyboard focus.



     Current (<font color="yellow">conditions</font color="yellow">) <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">
          Performs <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow"> on the current window if it  satisfies
          all    <font color="yellow">conditions</font color="yellow">.     Conditions   include   "Iconic",
          "!Iconic", "Visible", "!Visible", "Sticky",  "!Sticky",
          "Maximized",  "!Maximized",  "Transient", "!Transient",
          "Raised", "!Raised", "CurrentDesk", "CurrentPage",  and
          "CurrentPageAnyDesk".   In  addition, the condition may
          include a window name to match to.  The window name may
          include  the  wildcards * and ?.  The window name, icon
          name, class,  and  resource  will  be  considered  when
          attempting  to find a match.  The window name can begin
          with ! which will prevent <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow"> if any of the  window
          name, icon name, class or resource match.

          Note that earlier versions of fvwm2 required the condi-
          tions to be enclosed in brackets instead of parentheses
          (this is still supported for backwards compatibility).



     CursorMove <font color="yellow">horizontal</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">vertical</font color="yellow">
          Moves the mouse pointer by <font color="yellow">horizontal</font color="yellow"> pages  in  the  X
          direction  and  <font color="yellow">vertical</font color="yellow">  pages  in  the  Y  direction.
          Either or both entries may be negative.  Both  horizon-
          tal  and  vertical  values  are expressed in percent of
          pages, so "CursorMove 100 100" means to move  down  and
          right  by  one  full page.  "CursorMove 50 25" means to
          move right half a page and down a quarter  of  a  page.
          Alternatively,  the distance can be specified in pixels
          by appending a 'p' to the  horizontal  and/or  vertical
          specification.   For  example  "CursorMove  -10p  -10p"
          means move ten pixels up and ten pixels left.  The Cur-
          sorMove  function  should  not  be  called  from pop-up
          menus.


     CursorStyle <font color="yellow">context</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">cursornum</font color="yellow">
          Defines a new cursor for the  specified  context.   The
          various contexts are:

               POSITION (XC_top_left_corner)
                  used when initially placing windows

               TITLE (XC_top_left_arrow)
                  used in a window title-bar

               DEFAULT (XC_top_left_arrow)
                  used in windows that don't set their cursor

               SYS (XC_hand2)
                  used in one of the title-bar buttons

               MOVE (XC_fleur)
                  used when moving or resizing windows

               WAIT (XC_watch)
                  used during an EXEC builtin command

               MENU (XC_sb_left_arrow)
                  used in menus

               SELECT (XC_dot)
                  used  for  various  builtin  commands  such  as
                  iconify

               DESTROY (XC_pirate)
                  used for DESTROY, CLOSE, and DELETE built-ins

               TOP (XC_top_side)
                  used in the top side-bar of a window

               RIGHT (XC_right_side)
                  used in the right side-bar of a window

               BOTTOM (XC_bottom_side)
                  used in the bottom side-bar of a window

               LEFT (XC_left_side)
                  used in the left side-bar of a window

               TOP_LEFT (XC_top_left_corner)
                  used in the top left corner of a window

               TOP_RIGHT (XC_top_right_corner)
                  used in the top right corner of a window

               BOTTOM_LEFT (XC_bottom_left_corner)
                  used in the bottom left corner of a window

               BOTTOM_RIGHT (XC_bottom_right_corner)
                  used in the bottom right corner of a window

          And the cursornum is the numeric value of the cursor as
          defined in the include file X11/cursorfont.h.  An exam-
          ple:

               # make the kill cursor be XC_gumby:
               CursorStyle DESTROY 56

          The defaults are shown in parenthesis above.



     DefaultColors [  <font color="yellow">foreground</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">background</font color="yellow"> ]
          <font color="yellow">DefaultColors</font color="yellow"> sets the default forground and background
          colors  used  in miscellaneous windows created by fvwm,
          for example in the geometry feedback windows  during  a
          move  or resize operation.  If you don't want to change
          one color or the other, use - as  its  color  name.  To
          revert  to  the  builtin default colors omit both color
          names. Note that the default colors  are  not  used  in
          menus, window titles or icon titles.



     DefaultFont [ <font color="yellow">fontname</font color="yellow"> ]
          <font color="yellow">DefaultFont</font color="yellow"> sets the default  font  to  font  <font color="yellow">fontname</font color="yellow">.
          The  default  font  is  used by fvwm2 whenever no other
          font has been specified. To reset the default  font  to
          the  built  in  default, omit the argument. The default
          font is used for menus, window titles, icon  titles  as
          well  as the geometry feedback windows during a move or
          resize operation. To override the  default  font  in  a
          specific  context,  use  the  <font color="yellow">WindowFont</font color="yellow">,  <font color="yellow">IconFont</font color="yellow">  or
          <font color="yellow">MenuStyle</font color="yellow"> commands.



     Delete
          Sends a message to  a  window  asking  that  it  remove
          itself, frequently causing the application to exit.



     Desk <font color="yellow">arg1</font color="yellow"> [ <font color="yellow">arg2</font color="yellow"> ] [ <font color="yellow">min</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">max</font color="yellow"> ]
          Switches  the  current  viewport  to  another   desktop
          (workspace, room).

          The command takes 1, 2, 3, or  4  arguments.  A  single
          argument  is interpreted as a relative desk number. Two
          arguments are understood as a relative and an  absolute
          desk  number.  Three  arguments specify a relative desk
          and the minimum and maximum  of  the  allowable  range.
          Four  arguments specify the relative, absolute, minimum
          and maximum values. (Desktop numbers can be negative.)

          If <font color="yellow">arg1</font color="yellow"> is non zero then the next desktop  number  will
          be the current desktop number plus <font color="yellow">arg1</font color="yellow">.

          If <font color="yellow">arg1</font color="yellow"> is zero then the new  desktop  number  will  be
          <font color="yellow">arg2</font color="yellow">.  (If <font color="yellow">arg2</font color="yellow"> is not present, then the command has no
          effect.)

          If <font color="yellow">min</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">max</font color="yellow"> are given, the new desktop  number  will
          be  no  smaller than min and no bigger than max. Values
          out of this range are truncated (if you gave  an  abso-
          lute  desk  number)  or  wrapped  around (if you gave a
          relative desk number).

          The syntax is the same as for <font color="yellow">MoveToDesk</font color="yellow">, which moves a
          window to a different desktop.

          The number of active  desktops  is  determined  dynami-
          cally.   Only  desktops  which  contain  windows or are
          currently being displayed are active.  Desktop  numbers
          must  be  between  2147483647  and -2147483648 (is that
          enough?).

     DeskTopSize <font color="yellow">Horizontal</font color="yellow">x<font color="yellow">Vertical</font color="yellow">
          Defines the virtual desktop size in units of the physi-
          cal screen size.



     Destroy
          Destroys an application window,  which  usually  causes
          the application to crash and burn.



     DestroyDecor <font color="yellow">decor</font color="yellow">
          Deletes the <font color="yellow">decor</font color="yellow"> defined with AddToDecor, so that sub-
          sequent  references to it are no longer valid.  Windows
          using this <font color="yellow">decor</font color="yellow"> revert to the default fvwm decor.  The
          decor named "Default" cannot be destroyed.

     DestroyFunc
          Deletes a function, so that subsequent references to it
          are  no  longer  valid.  You can use this to change the
          contents of a function during  an  fvwm  session.   The
          function can be rebuilt using AddToFunc.

               DestroyFunc "PrintFunction"




     DestroyMenu
          Deletes a menu, so that subsequent references to it are
          no  longer  valid.  You can use this to change the con-

     DestroyModuleConfig
          Deletes module configuration entries, so that new  con-
          figuration  lines  may be entered instead.  You can use
          this to change the the way a module runs during an fvwm
          session  without restarting.  Wildcards can be used for
          portions of the name as well.

     Direction <font color="yellow">direction</font color="yellow"> (<font color="yellow">conditions</font color="yellow">) <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">
          Performs <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow"> (typically Focus) on a window  in  the
          given direction which satisfies all <font color="yellow">conditions</font color="yellow">.  Condi-
          tions are the same as for <font color="yellow">Current</font color="yellow">. The <font color="yellow">direction</font color="yellow"> may be
          one   of  North,  Northeast,  East,  Southeast,  South,
          Southwest, West and Northwest. Which  window  Direction
          selects  depends on angle and distance between the cen-
          terpoints of the windows. Closer windows are considered
          a better match than those farther away.

     EdgeResistance <font color="yellow">scrolling</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">moving</font color="yellow">
          Tells how hard it  should  be  to  change  the  desktop
          viewport  by  moving  the  mouse  over  the edge of the
          screen and how hard it should be to move a window  over
          the edge of the screen.

          The first parameter tells how milliseconds the  pointer
          must spend on the screen edge before <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> will move the
          viewport.   This  is  intended  for  people   who   use
          "EdgeScroll  100  100" but find themselves accidentally
          flipping pages when they don't want to.

          The second parameter tells how  many  pixels  over  the
          edge  of the screen a window's edge must move before it
          actually moves partially off the screen. By default the
          viewport  is  moved a full page in the requested direc-
          tion, but if you used <font color="yellow">EdgeScroll</font color="yellow">  and  set  any  values
          other than zero they will be used instead.
          Note that, with "EdgeScroll 0 0", it is still  possible
          to  move  or  resize  windows  across  the  edge of the
          current screen.   By  making  the  first  parameter  to
          EdgeResistance 10000 this type of motion is impossible.
          With EdgeResistance less than 10000 but greater than  0
          moving over pages becomes difficult but not impossible.
          See also, EdgeThickness.


     EdgeScroll <font color="yellow">horizontal</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">vertical</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the percentage of a page to scroll  when  the
          cursor hits the edge of a page.  A trailing "p" changes
          the interpretation to mean "pixels".  If you don't want
          any paging or scrolling when you hit the edge of a page
          include "EdgeScroll 0 0" in your .fvwm2rc file, or pos-
          sibly  better,  set the EdgeThickness to zero.  See the
          EdgeThickness command. If you  want  whole  pages,  use
          "EdgeScroll  100  100".   Both  horizontal and vertical
          should be positive numbers.

          If the horizontal and vertical percentages  are  multi-
          plied  by  1000  then scrolling will wrap around at the
          edge of the desktop.  If "EdgeScroll 100000 100000"  is
          used  <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">  will scroll by whole pages, wrapping around
          at the edge of the desktop.


     EdgeThickness <font color="yellow">0</font color="yellow">|<font color="yellow">1</font color="yellow">|<font color="yellow">2</font color="yellow">
          This is the width or height  of  the  invisible  window
          that  fvwm2 creates on the edges of the screen that are
          used for the edgescrolling feature.

          A value of  zero completely disables  mouse edge scrol-
          ling, even while dragging a window.

          1 gives the  smallest pan frames,  which seem to   work
          best  except on some servers.

          2 is the default.

          Pan frames of 1 or 2 pixels can sometimes be confusing,
          for  example, if you drag a window over the edge of the
          screen, so that it stradles aa pan frame, clicks on the
          window,  near  the  edge  of  the screen are treated as
          clicks on the root window.



     Emulate <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">|<font color="yellow">mwm</font color="yellow">|<font color="yellow">win</font color="yellow">
          This command affects how miscellaneous things are  done
          by  fvwm.   For  example where the move/resize feedback
          window appears depends on this command.  To  have  more
          MWM-  or  WIN-like  behavior  you can call Emulate with
          "MWM" or "WIN" as its argument.



     Exec <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">
          Executes <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">.  You  should  not  use  an  ampersand
          ``&amp;''  at the end of the command.  You probably want to
          use an additional ``exec'' at the beginning of <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">.
          Without  that,  the shell that fvwm invokes to run your
          command will stay until the command exits.  In  effect,
          you'll  have  twice  as  many  processes running as you
          need.  Note that some shells are smart enough to  avoid
          this,  but  it never hurts to include the ``exec'' any-
          way.

          The following example binds function key F1 in the root
          window,  with  no modifiers, to the exec function.  The
          program rxvt will be  started  with  an  assortment  of
          options.

               Key F1 R N Exec exec rxvt -fg yellow -bg blue \
                 -e /bin/tcsh


          Note that this function doesn't  wait  for  <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">  to
          complete, so things like:

               Exec "echo AddToMenu ... &gt; /tmp/file"
               Read /tmp/file

          won't work reliably.


     ExecUseShell [ <font color="yellow">shell</font color="yellow"> ]
          Makes the Exec command use the specified shell, or  the
          value of the $SHELL environment variable if no shell is
          specified,  instead  of  the   default   Bourne   shell
          (/bin/sh).

               ExecUseShell
               ExecUseShell /usr/local/bin/tcsh




     FlipFocus
          Executes a <font color="yellow">Focus</font color="yellow"> command as if the user  had  used  the
          pointer  to select the window.  This command alters the
          order of the windowlist in the same way as clicking  in
          a  window  to  focus, i.e. the target window is removed
          from the windowlist  and  placed  at  the  start.  This
          command  is recommended for use with the <font color="yellow">Direction</font color="yellow"> com-
          mand and in the function invoked from <font color="yellow">WindowList</font color="yellow">.



     Focus
          Moves the viewport or window  as  needed  to  make  the
          selected  window  visible.   Sets the keyboard focus to
          the selected window.  Does not automatically raise  the
          window.   Does  not  warp the pointer into the selected
          window  (see  WarpToWindow  function).   Does  not  de-
          iconify.   This command does not alter the order of the
          windowlist, it rotates the windowlist  around  so  that
          the target window is at the start.

          To raise and warp a  pointer  together  with  Focus  or
          FlipFocus, use a function:

               AddToFunc SelectWindow
               + I Focus
               + I Raise
               + I WarpToWindow 50 8p




     Function <font color="yellow">FunctionName</font color="yellow">
          Used to bind a previously defined function to a key  or
          mouse button.

          The following example binds mouse button 1 to  a  func-
          tion  called "Move-or-Raise", whose definition was pro-
          vided as an example earlier in this  man  page.   After
          performing  this  binding <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> will execute to move-or-
          raise function whenever button 1 is pressed in a window
          title-bar.

               Mouse 1 T A Function Move-or-Raise

          The keyword "Function" may be omitted if "FunctionName"
          does not coincide with an fvwm built-in function name



     GlobalOpts [ <font color="yellow">options</font color="yellow"> ]
          This is a TEMPORARY command used  to  set  some  global
          options  which will later be handled as Style parms (or
          options to Style parms).  It currently handles the fol-
          lowing:
          SmartPlacementIsReallySmart/SmartPlacementIsNormal,
          ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick/ClickToFocusPassesClick,
          ClickToFocusDoesntRaise/ClickToFocusRaises,
          MouseFocusClickDoesntRaise/MouseFocusClickRaises,
          CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage/CaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage,
          RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage/RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage,
          ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage/ActivePlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage,
          NoStipledTitles/StipledTitles

          Example:

               GlobalOpts ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick, \
                 ClickToFocusDoesntRaise


          RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage  causes  a  window  to   be
          placed  according  to,  or  revert to, the StartsOnPage
          desk and page specification on  Restart  or  Recapture.
          RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage causes fvwm to respect the
          current window position on Restart  or  Recapture.  The
          default is RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage.

          CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage causes  the  initial  capture
          (of an already existing window) at startup to place the
          window according to  the  StartsOnPage  desk  and  page
          specification.  CaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage  causes fvwm
          to ignore these settings  (including  StartsOnDesk)  on
          initial  capture. The default is CaptureHonorsStartsOn-
          Page.

          ActivePlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage suppresses StartsOn-
          Page  or  StartsOnDesk placement in the event that both
          ActivePlacement and SkipMapping are in  effect  when  a
          window is created. This prevents you from interactively
          placing a window and then  wondering  where  it  disap-
          peared to, because it got placed on a different desk or
          page. ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage allows this  to
          happen  anyway. The option has no effect if SkipMapping
          is not in effect,  because  fvwm  will  switch  to  the
          proper  desk/page to perform interactive placement. The
          default  is  ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage,   which
          matches the way StartsOnDesk handled the situation.


     GotoPage x y
          Moves the desktop viewport to page  (x,y).   The  upper
          left  page  is (0,0), the upper right is (M,0), where M
          is one less than the current number of horizontal pages
          specified  in  the DeskTopSize command.  The lower left
          page is (0,N), and the lower right page is (M,N), where
          N  is  the  desktop's vertical size as specified in the
          DeskTopSize command.  The GotoPage function should  not
          be used in a pop-up menu.


     HilightColor <font color="yellow">textcolor</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">backgroundcolor</font color="yellow">
          Specifies  the  text  and  background  colors  for  the
          decorations  on the window which currently has the key-
          board focus.



     IconFont [ <font color="yellow">fontname</font color="yellow"> ]
          Makes <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> use font <font color="yellow">fontname</font color="yellow"> for icon labels. To  reset
          this font to the default font (see <font color="yellow">DefaultFont</font color="yellow">) you may
          omit <font color="yellow">fontname</font color="yellow">.



     Iconify [ <font color="yellow">value</font color="yellow"> ]
          Iconifies a window if it is not  already  iconified  or
          de-iconifies  it  if  it  is already iconified.  If the
          optional argument <font color="yellow">value</font color="yellow"> is positive only  iconification
          will  be allowed.  If the optional argument is negative
          only de-iconification will be allowed.



     IconPath <font color="yellow">path</font color="yellow">
          Specifies a colon separated list of full path names  of
          directories  where  bitmap  (monochrome)  icons  can be
          found.  Each path should start with a slash.   Environ-
          ment variables can be used here as well (i.e.  $HOME or
          ${HOME}).

          Note: if the FvwmM4 is used to  parse  your  rc  files,
          then  <font color="yellow">m4</font color="yellow">  may  want  to mangle the word "include" which
          will frequently show up in the IconPath  or  PixmapPath
          command.   To fix this add undefine(`include') prior to
          the IconPath command, or better  use  the  '-m4-prefix'
          option  to  force all m4 directives to have a prefix of
          "m4_" (see the <font color="yellow">FvwmM4</font color="yellow"> man page).



     ImagePath <font color="yellow">path</font color="yellow">
          Specifies a colon  separated  list  of  directories  in
          which  to  search  for images (both monochrome and pix-
          map).

          <font color="yellow">NOTE</font color="yellow">: ImagePath makes obsolete IconPath and  PixmapPath
          commands in the next fvwm versions. In this version all
          of the three commands are allowed.

          The ImagePath may contain environment variables such as
          $HOME  (or  ${HOME}).   Further,  a  '+' in the path is
          expanded to the previous value of  the  path,  allowing
          easy appending or prepending to the path.

          For example:

               ImagePath $HOME/icons:+:/usr/include/X11/bitmaps




     Key <font color="yellow">keyname</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">Context</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">Modifiers</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">Function</font color="yellow">
          Binds a keyboard key to a specified <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> built-in func-
          tion,  or  removes  the  binding  if  <font color="yellow">Function</font color="yellow">  is '-'.
          Definition is the same as for a  mouse  binding  except
          that  the  mouse  button  number is replaced with a key
          name.   The  <font color="yellow">keyname</font color="yellow">  is  one  of  the   entries   from
          /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h,   with  the  leading  XK_
          omitted.  The <font color="yellow">Context</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">Modifiers</font color="yellow"> fields are  defined
          as  in the Mouse binding. However, when you press a key
          the context window is the window that has the  keyboard
          focus.  That  is not necessarily the same as the window
          the pointer is over (with SloppyFocus or ClickToFocus).

          The following example binds the built in window list to
          pop  up when Alt-Ctrl-Shift-F11 is hit, no matter where
          the mouse pointer is:

               Key F11 A SCM WindowList


          Binding a key to a title-bar button will not cause that
          button to appear unless a mouse binding also exists.



     KillModule <font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow">
          Causes the module which was invoked with name  <font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow">  to
          be killed.  <font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow"> may include wild-cards.



     Lower
          Allows the user to lower a window.



     Maximize [  <font color="yellow">horizontal</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">vertical</font color="yellow"> ]
          Without its optional arguments Maximize causes the win-
          dow  to  alternately  switch from a full-screen size to
          its normal size.

          With the optional arguments  horizontal  and  vertical,
          which are expressed as percentage of a full screen, the
          user can control the new size of the window.   If  hor-
          izontal is greater than 0 then the horizontal dimension
          of     the     window     will      be      set      to
          horizontal*screen_width/100.   The vertical resizing is
          similar.  For example, the following will add a  title-
          bar button to switch a window to the full vertical size
          of the screen:

               Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 0 100

          The following causes windows to  be  stretched  to  the
          full width:

               Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 100 0

          This makes a window that is half  the  screen  size  in
          each direction:

               Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 50 50

          Values larger than 100 can be used with caution.

          If the letter "p" is appended to each coordinate  (hor-
          izontal  and/or  vertical), then the scroll amount will
          be measured in pixels.



     Menu <font color="yellow">menu</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow"> [ <font color="yellow">position</font color="yellow"> ] [ <font color="yellow">double</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">click</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow"> ]
          Causes a previously defined menu to be popped up  in  a
          "sticky" manner.  That is, if the user invokes the menu
          with a click action instead of a drag action, the  menu
          will  stay up.  The command <font color="yellow">double</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">click</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow"> will be
          invoked if the user  double-clicks  (or  hits  the  key
          rapidly  twice  if  the  menu  is  bound to a key) when
          bringing the menu up.

          Several other  commands  affect  menu  operation.   See
          <font color="yellow">MenuStyle</font color="yellow">  and  <font color="yellow">SetAnimation</font color="yellow">.  When in a menu, keyboard
          shortcuts work as expected.  Cursor keystrokes are also
          allowed.  Specifically, Cursor-Down, Ctrl-N, and Ctrl-J
          all move to the  next  item;   Cursor-Up,  Ctrl-P,  and
          Ctrl-K  all  move  to  the  prior item; Cursor-Left and
          Ctrl-B return to  the  prior  menu;   Cursor-Right  and
          Ctrl-F  popup  the  next menu; Ctrl-Cursor-Up and Ctrl-
          Cursor-Down move up and down five items,  respectively;
          Shift-Cursor-Up and Shift-Cursor-Down move to the first
          and  last  items,  respectively;  Enter  executes   the
          current  item;  Escape  exits  the  current sequence of
          menus.

          The pointer will be warped to where  it  was  when  the
          menu  was invoked if it was both invoked and terminated
          with a keystroke.

          The <font color="yellow">position</font color="yellow"> arguments allow to place  the  menu  some-
          where  on the screen, for example centered on the visi-
          ble screen or above a title bar.   Basically  it  works
          like  this:  you  specify  a  <font color="yellow">context</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">rectangle</font color="yellow">  and an
          offset to this rectangle by which the upper left corner
          of  the menu is moved from the upper left corner of the
          rectangle.  The <font color="yellow">position</font color="yellow"> arguments consist  of  several
          parts:

               [ [context-rectangle] x y ] [ special-options ]

          The <font color="yellow">context</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">rectangle</font color="yellow"> can be one of:

               Root
                  the root window.
               Mouse
                  a 1x1 rectangle at the mouse position.
               Window
                  the window with the focus.
               Interior
                  the inside of the focused window.
               Title
                  the title of the focused window or icon.

                  button #n of the focused window.
               Icon
                  the focused icon.
               Menu
                  the current menu.
               Item
                  the current menu item.
               Context
                  the current window, menu or icon.
               This
                  whatever widget  the  pointer  is  on  (e.g.  a
                  corner of a window or the root window).
               Rectangle &lt;geometry&gt;
                  the  rectangle  defined  by  &lt;<font color="yellow">geometry</font color="yellow">&gt;  in   X
                  geometry format.  Width and height default to 1
                  if omitted.

          If the context-rectangle  is  omitted  "Mouse"  is  the
          default.   Note  that not all of these make sense under
          all circumstances (e.g. "Icon" if the pointer is  on  a
          menu).

          The offset values <font color="yellow">x</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">y</font color="yellow"> specify how far the  menu  is
          moved  from  it's  default  position.  By  default, the
          numeric value given is interpreted as a  percentage  of
          the  context  rectangle's  width  (height),  but with a
          trailing "m" the menu's width (height) is used instead.
          Furthermore  a  trailing "p" changes the interpretation
          to mean "pixels".

          Instead of a single value you can use a list of values.
          All   additional   numbers  after  the  first  one  are
          separated from threir predecessor but  their  sign.  Do
          not use any other separators.

          If x or y are prefixed with 'o&lt;number&gt;' where  &lt;number&gt;
          is an integer, the menu and the rectangle will be moved
          to overlap at the specified position before  any  other
          offsets are applied. The menu and the rectangle will be
          placed so that the pixel at  &lt;number&gt;  percent  of  the
          rectangle's  width/height  is  right  over the pixel at
          &lt;number&gt; percent of the menu's width/height.   So  'o0'
          means  that  the  top/left  borders of the menu and the
          rectangle overlap, with 'o100'  it's  the  bottom/right
          borders  and  if  you  use 'o50' they are centered upon
          each other (try it and you will see it is much  simpler
          than this description). The default is 'o0'. The prefix

          A prefix of 'c' is equivalent of 'o50'.  Examples:


               # window list in the middle of the screen
               WindowList Root c c

               # menu to the left of a window
               Menu name window -100m c+0

               # popup menu 8 pixels above the mouse pointer
               Popup name mouse c -100m-8p

               # somewhere on the screen
               Menu name rectangle 512x384+1+1 +0 +0

               # centered vertially around a menu item
               AddToMenu foobar-menu
                + "first item" Nop
                + "special item" Popup "another menu" item \
                                 +100 c
                + "last item" Nop

               # above the first menu item
               AddToMenu foobar-menu
                + "first item" Popup "another menu" item +0 -100m

          Note that you can put a submenu  far  off  the  current
          menu  so  you could not reach it with the mouse without
          leaving the menu. If the  pointer  leaves  the  current
          menu  in  the general direction of the submenu the menu
          will stay up.

          The <font color="yellow">special</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">options</font color="yellow">:

               The "animated" and "mwm" or "win" meny styles  may
               move  a menu somewhere else on the screen.  If you
               do not want this you can add <font color="yellow">Fixed</font color="yellow"> as  an  option.
               This might happen for example if you want the menu
               always in the top right corner of the screen.

               Where do you want a submenu  to  appear  when  you
               click  on it's menu item?  The default is to place
               the title under the cursor, but  if  you  want  it
               where  the  position arguments say, use the <font color="yellow">Selec-</font color="yellow">
               <font color="yellow">tInPlace</font color="yellow"> option.  If you want the pointer  on  the
               title of the menu, use <font color="yellow">SelectWarp</font color="yellow"> too.

               The pointer is warped to the title  of  a  submenu
               whenever  the pointer would be on an item when the
               submenu is popped up ("fvwm" menu style) or  never
               warped  to  thetitle  at  all ("mwm" or "win" menu
               styles). You can force (forbid)  warping  whenever
               the  submenu is opened with the <font color="yellow">WarpTitle</font color="yellow"> (<font color="yellow">NoWarp</font color="yellow">)
               option.

               Note that the <font color="yellow">special</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">options</font color="yellow"> do work with a  nor-
               mal menu that has no other position arguments.

          all   others  except  Foreground,  Background,  Greyed,
          HilightBack, HilightFore and PopupDelay, so they should
          be  used  only as the first option specified for a menu
          style or to reset the style to defined  bahavior.   The

          <font color="yellow">Foreground</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">Background</font color="yellow"> may have a color name  as  an
          argument.  This  color  is  used  for  menu text or the
          menu's background.  You can  omit  the  color  name  to
          reset these colors to the built in default.

          <font color="yellow">Greyed</font color="yellow"> may have a color name as an argument. This color
          is  the  one  used  to  draw  a menu-selection which is
          prohibited (or not recommended) by the mwm-hints  which
          an  application has specified.  If the color is omitted
          the color of "greyed" menu  entries  is  based  on  the
          background color of the menu.

          <font color="yellow">HilightBack</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">HilightBackOff</font color="yellow">  switch  hilighting  the
          background  of  the  selected  menu  item on and off. A
          specific background color may be used by providing  the
          color  name  as  an argument to <font color="yellow">HilightBack</font color="yellow">. If you use
          this option without an argument the color is  based  on
          the menu's background color.

          <font color="yellow">ActiveFore</font color="yellow">  and  <font color="yellow">ActiveForeOff</font color="yellow">  switch  hilighting  the
          foreground  of  the  selected  menu  item on and off. A
          specific foreground color may be used by providing  the
          color  name  as an argument to ActiveFore. Omitting the
          color name has the same effet as using ActiveForeOff.

          <font color="yellow">Hilight3DThick</font color="yellow">, <font color="yellow">Hilight3DThin</font color="yellow"> and  <font color="yellow">Hilight3DOff</font color="yellow">  deter-
          mine  if  the selected menu item is hilighted with a 3D
          relief.   Thick  reliefs  are  two  pixels  wide,  thin
          reliefs are one pixel wide.

          <font color="yellow">Animation</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">AnimationOff</font color="yellow"> turn menu  animation  on  or
          off.  When animation is on, sub-menus that don't fit on
          the screen cause the parent menu to be shifted  to  the
          left so the sub-menu can be seen.

          <font color="yellow">Font</font color="yellow"> takes a font name as an argument.  If  a  font  by
          this  name  exists  it is used for the text of all menu
          items. If it does not exist or  if  the  name  is  left
          blank the built in default is used.

          <font color="yellow">MenuFace</font color="yellow"> enforces a fancy background  upon  the  menus.
          You  can  use the same options for MenuFace as for But-
          tonStyle plus DGradient, (top-left to  down-right)  and
          BGradient (down-left to top-right). See <font color="yellow">ButtonStyle</font color="yellow"> for
          more info. If you use MenuFace  without  arguments  the
          style is reverted back to normal.

          Some examples of MenuFaces are:


               MenuFace DGradient 128 2 lightgrey 50 blue 50 white
               MenuFace TiledPixmap texture10.xpm
               MenuFace HGradient 128 2 Red 40 Maroon 60 White
               MenuFace Solid Maroon


          If you encounter  performance  problems  with  gradient
          backgrounds you can try one or all of the following:

          Turn Hilighting of the active menu item other than for-
          ground color off:





               MenuStyle &lt;stylename&gt; Hilight3DOff, HilightBackOff
               MenuStyle ActiveFore &lt;preferred color&gt;


          Make sure submenus do not overlap the parent menu. This
          can  prevent  menus  being redrawn every time a submenu
          pops up or down.


               MenuStyle &lt;stylename&gt; PopupOffset 1 100


          Run you X server with backing storage. If your  Xserver
          is started with the -bs option, turn it off. If not try
          the -wm option.


               startx -- -wm


          You may have to adapt this example to your system (e.g.
          if you use xinit to start X).

          <font color="yellow">PopupDelay</font color="yellow"> requires one numeric argument. This value is
          the  delay  in milliseconds before a sub-menu is popped
          up when the pointer moves over a menu item that  has  a
          sub-menu. If the value is zero no automatical pop up is
          done. If the argument is omitted the built  in  default
          is used. Note that the popup delay has no effect if the
          <font color="yellow">PopupImmediately</font color="yellow"> option is used since sub-menus pop  up
          immediately  then. The PopupDelay option should only be
          applied to the default style ('*') since it is a global
          setting and affects all menus.

          <font color="yellow">PopupImmediately</font color="yellow"> makes menu items with sub menus pop up
          it  up  as  soon  as  the  pointer enters the item. The
          PopupDelay is ignored then.  If  <font color="yellow">PopupDelayed</font color="yellow">  is  used
          fvwm2  looks  at  the <font color="yellow">PopupDelay</font color="yellow"> option if or when this
          automatic popup happens.

          <font color="yellow">PopupOffset</font color="yellow"> requires two integer arguments. Both values
          affect  where  sub-menus  are  placed  relative  to the
          parent menu. If both values are zero, the left edge  of
          the sub-menu overlaps the left edge of the parent menu.
          If the first value is non-zero the sub-menu is  shifted
          that many pixels to the right (or left if negative). If
          the second value is non-zero the menu is moved by  that
          many percent of the parent menu's width to the right or
          left.

          <font color="yellow">TitleWarp</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">TitleWarpOff</font color="yellow"> affect if the pointer  warps
          to the menu title when a sub-menu is opened or not. Not
          that regardless of this setting the pointer will not be
          warped if the menu does not pop up under the pointer.

          <font color="yellow">TitleUnderlines0</font color="yellow">, <font color="yellow">TitleUnderlines1</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">TitleUnderlines2</font color="yellow">
          specify how many lines are drawn below a menu title.

          <font color="yellow">SeparatorsLong</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">SeparatorsShort</font color="yellow"> set  the  length  of
          menu separators. Long separators run from the left edge
          all the way to the right edge. Short separators leave a
          few pixels to the edges of the menu.

          <font color="yellow">TrianglesSolid</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">TrianglesRelief</font color="yellow"> affect how the small
          triangles  for  sub-menus is drawn. Solid triangles are
          filled with a color while relief triangles are hollow.

          <font color="yellow">DoubleClickTime</font color="yellow"> requires  one  numeric  argument.  This
          value  is  the  time  in milliseconds between two mouse
          clicks in a menu to be considered as  a  double  click.
          The  default  is  450 milliseconds.  If the argument is
          omitted the doucle click time is reset to this default.
          The  DoubleClickTime  option  should only be applied to
          the default style ('*') since it is  a  global  setting
          and affects all menus.

          <font color="yellow">SidePic</font color="yellow"> takes the name of an xpm or bitmap file  as  an
          argument.   The picture is drawn along the left side of
          the menu. The SidePic option can  be  overridden  by  a
          menu  specific side pixmap (see <font color="yellow">AddToMenu</font color="yellow">). If the file
          name is omitted an existing side pixmap is remove  from
          the menu style.

          <font color="yellow">SideColor</font color="yellow"> takes the name of an X11 color  as  an  argu-
          ment.  This  color  is used to colorize the column con-
          taining the side picture  (see  above).  The  SideColor
          option  can be overridden by a menu specific side color
          (see <font color="yellow">AddToMenu</font color="yellow">). If the color name is omitted the  side
          color option is switched off.

     MenuStyle <font color="yellow">forecolor</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">backcolor</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">shadecolor</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">font</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">style</font color="yellow"> [ <font color="yellow">anim</font color="yellow"> ]
          This is the old syntax of the MenuStyle command. It  is
          obsolete  and  may be removed in the future. Please use
          the new syntax as described above.

          Sets the menu style.  When using monochrome the  colors
          are ignored.  The shade-color is the one used to draw a
          menu-selection which is prohibited (or not recommended)
          by  the  mwm-hints  which an application has specified.
          The style option is either "fvwm" "mwm" or "win", which
          changes  the  appearance and operation of the menus and
          where the feedback window appears  during  resizes  and
          moves.

          "mwm" and "win" style menus popup  sub-menus  automati-
          cally.   "win"  menus indicate the current menu item by
          changing the background  to  black.   "fvwm"  sub-menus
          overlap  the  parent  menu, "mwm" and "win" style menus
          never overlap the parent menu.  "mwm" resize  and  move
          feedback  windows  are  in  the  center  of the screen,
          instead of the upper left corner.

          The "anim" option is either "anim" or blank.  When this
          option  is  "anim",  sub-menus  that  don't  fit on the
          screen cause the parent menu to be shifted to the  left
          so the sub-menu can be seen.

     Module <font color="yellow">ModuleName</font color="yellow">
          Specifies a module which should be spawned during  ini-
          tialization.  At the current time the available modules
          (included with fvwm) are FvwmAnimate  (fancy  animation
          of  (de)iconification)  FvwmAudio  (makes  sounds to go
          with window manager actions), FvwmAuto (an  auto  raise
          module),  FvwmBacker (to change the background when you
          change desktops), FvwmBanner (to display a spiffy XPM),
          FvwmButtons   (brings  up  a  customizable  tool  bar),
          FvwmCpp  (to  preprocess  your  .fvwm2rc   with   cpp),
          FvwmEvent (trigger various actions by events), FvwmForm
          (to bring up dialogs), FvwmIconBox (like the mwm  Icon-
          Box),   FvwmIconMan   (like   the  twm  icon  manager),
          FvwmIdent (to get window info), FvwmM4  (to  preprocess
          your  .fvwm2rc  with  m4), FvwmPager (a mini version of
          the desktop), FvwmSave  (saves  the  desktop  state  in
          .xinitrc  style), FvwmSaveDesk (saves the desktop state
          in fvwm commands), FvwmScroll (puts scrollbars  on  any
          window), FvwmTalk (to interactively run fvwm commands),
          and FvwmWinList (a window list), FvwmAnimate  (produces
          animation effects when a window is iconified or deicon-
          ifed).  These modules have their own man pages.   There
          are other modules out on there as well.

          Modules can be short lived transient programs or,  like
          FvwmButtons,  can remain for the duration of the X ses-
          sion.  Modules will be terminated by the window manager
          prior  to  restarts  and  quits,  if possible.  See the
          introductory section on modules.  The keyword  "module"
          may  be  omitted  if  <font color="yellow">ModuleName</font color="yellow">  is  distinct from all
          built-in and function names.



     ModulePath
          Specifies a colon separated list of paths for  <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">  to
          search  when  looking for a module to load.  Individual
          directories do not need trailing slashes.   Environment
          variables  can  be  used  here  as well (i.e.  $HOME or
          ${HOME}).  The builtin module path is available via the
          environment variable $FVWM_MODULEDIR.



     Mouse <font color="yellow">Button</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">Context</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">Modifiers</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">Function</font color="yellow">
          Defines a mouse binding,  or  removes  the  binding  if
          <font color="yellow">Function</font color="yellow">  is  zero  then  any  button  will perform the
          specified function.  <font color="yellow">Context</font color="yellow"> describes where the  bind-
          ing applies.  Valid contexts are R for the root window,
          W for an application window, T for a window title  bar,
          S for a window side, top, or bottom bar, F for a window
          frame (the corners), I for an Icon window, or 0 through
          9  for  title-bar  buttons, or any combination of these
          letters.  A is for any  context  except  for  title-bar
          buttons.   For  instance,  a  context of FST will apply
          when the mouse is anywhere in a window's border  except
          the title-bar buttons.

          <font color="yellow">Modifiers</font color="yellow"> is any combination of N for no  modifiers,  C
          for  control,  S  for  shift,  M for Meta, or A for any
          modifier.  For example, a modifier  of  SM  will  apply
          when both the Meta and Shift keys are down.  X11 modif-
          iers mod1 through mod5 are represented as the digits  1
          through 5.

          <font color="yellow">Function</font color="yellow"> is one of <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">'s built-in functions.

          The title bar buttons are numbered  with  odd  numbered
          buttons  on  the  left  side  of the title bar and even
          numbers on the  right.   Smaller-numbered  buttons  are
          displayed  toward  the  outside  of  the  window  while
          larger-numbered buttons appear toward the middle of the
          window  (0  is  short for 10).  In summary, the buttons
          are numbered:

               1 3 5 7 9    0 8 6 4 2

          The highest odd numbered button  which  has  an  action
          bound  to  it determines the number of buttons drawn on
          the left side of  the  title  bar.   The  highest  even
          number  determines  the  number  or  right side buttons
          which are drawn.  Actions can be bound to either  mouse
          buttons or keyboard keys.



     Move [ <font color="yellow">x</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">y</font color="yellow"> [ <font color="yellow">Warp</font color="yellow"> ] ]
          Allows the user to move a window.  If called from some-
          where  in a window or its border, then that window will
          be moved.  If called from the root window then the user
          will  be  allowed  to  select the target window. If the
          optional argument <font color="yellow">Warp</font color="yellow">  is  specified  the  pointer  is
          warped with the window.

          The operation can be aborted with Escape or by pressing
          any  mouse  button  (except button 1 which confirms the
          move).

          If the optional arguments x and y  are  provided,  then
          the  window  will  be  moved  immediately  without user
          interaction.  Each argument can specify an absolute  or
          relative  position  from either the left (top) or right
          (bottom) of the screen.  By default, the numeric  value
          given  is  interpreted  as  a  percentage of the screen
          width  (height),  but  a  trailing  "p"   changes   the
          interpretation to mean "pixels".

          Simple Examples:

               # Interactive move
               Mouse 1 T A Move
               # Move window so top left is at (10%,10%)
               Mouse 2 T A Move 10 10
               # Move top left to (10pixels,10pixels)
               Mouse 3 T A Move 10p 10p


          More complex examples (these can be bound as actions to
          keystrokes, etc.; only the command is shown, though):

               # Move window so bottom right is at bottom
               # right of screen
               Move -0 -0

               # Move window 5% to the right, and to the
               # middle vertically
               Move w+5 50

               # Move window up 10 pixels, and so left edge
               # is at x=40 pixels
               Move 40p w-10p


          See also the "AnimatedMove" command, above.



     MoveToDesk <font color="yellow">arg1</font color="yellow"> [ <font color="yellow">arg2</font color="yellow"> ] [ <font color="yellow">min</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">max</font color="yellow"> ]
          Moves  the   selected   window   to   another   desktop
          (workspace, room).

          The arguments are the same as  for  the  <font color="yellow">Desk</font color="yellow">  command.
          MoveToDesk  is  a  replacement  for the old WindowsDesk
          command, which can no longer be used.



     MoveToPage [ <font color="yellow">x</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">y</font color="yellow"> ]
          Moves the selected window to another  page  (x,y).  The
          upper  left  page  is  (0,0), the upper right is (M,0),
          where M is one less than the current number of horizon-
          tal  pages  specified  in the DeskTopSize command.  The
          lower left page is (0,N), and the lower right  page  is
          (M,N), where N is the desktop's vertical size as speci-
          fied in the DeskTopSize command. If <font color="yellow">x</font color="yellow">  and  <font color="yellow">y</font color="yellow">  are  not
          given,  the window is moved to the current page (a win-
          dow that  has  the  focus  but  is  off-screen  can  be
          retrieved with this).



     Next (<font color="yellow">conditions</font color="yellow">) <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">
          Performs <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow"> (typically Focus) on the  next  window
          which  satisfies  all  <font color="yellow">conditions</font color="yellow">.   Conditions are the
          same as for <font color="yellow">Current</font color="yellow"> with the addition  of  CirculateHit
          which  overrides  the CirculateSkip style attribute and
          CirculateHitIcon which overrides the  CirculateSkipIcon
          style attribute for iconified windows.

     None (<font color="yellow">conditions</font color="yellow">) <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">
          Performs <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow"> if no window which satisfies all  <font color="yellow">con-</font color="yellow">
          <font color="yellow">ditions</font color="yellow"> exists.  Conditions are the same as for <font color="yellow">Next</font color="yellow">.



     Nop  Does nothing.  This is used to insert a blank  line  or
          separator in a menu.  If the menu item specification is
          Nop " ", then a blank line is inserted.   If  it  looks
          like  Nop  "",  then a separator line is inserted.  Can
          also be used as the double-click action for Menu.



     OpaqueMoveSize <font color="yellow">percentage</font color="yellow">
          Tells <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> the maximum size window  with  which  opaque
          window movement should be used.  The percentage is per-
          cent of the total screen area.  With "OpaqueMoveSize 0"
          all   windows  will  be  moved  using  the  traditional
          rubber-band outline.   With  "OpaqueMoveSize  100"  all
          windows  will be move as solid windows.  The default is
          "OpaqueMoveSize 5", which allows small  windows  to  be
          moved  in  an opaque manner but large windows are moved
          as rubber-bands.



     PipeRead <font color="yellow">cmd</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">option</font color="yellow">
          Causes fvwm to read commands output  from  the  program
          named <font color="yellow">cmd</font color="yellow">.  Useful for building up dynamic menu entries
          based on a directories contents, for example.



     PixmapPath <font color="yellow">path</font color="yellow">
          Specifies a colon separated list of full path names  of
          directories  where  pixmap  (color) icons can be found.
          Each path should start with a slash.  Environment vari-
          ables  can  be  used  here  as  well  (i.e.   $HOME  or
          ${HOME}).



     Popup <font color="yellow">PopupName</font color="yellow"> [ <font color="yellow">position</font color="yellow"> ] [ <font color="yellow">default</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow"> ]
          This built-in has two purposes: to bind a menu to a key
          or  mouse  button,  and to bind a sub-menu into a menu.
          The formats for the two purposes differ slightly.   The
          <font color="yellow">position</font color="yellow">  arguments are the same as for <font color="yellow">Menu</font color="yellow">.  The com-
          mand <font color="yellow">default</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow"> will be invoked if the user  clicks
          a button to invoke the menu and releases it immediately
          again (or hits the key rapidly twice  if  the  menu  is
          bound to a key).
          To bind a previously defined pop-up menu to  a  key  or
          mouse button:

            The following example binds mouse buttons 2 and 3  to
            a  pop-up  called "Window Ops".  The menu will pop up
            if the buttons 2 or  3  are  pressed  in  the  window
            frame,  side-bar,  or  title-bar,  with  no modifiers
            (none of shift, control, or meta).

                 Mouse 2 FST N Popup "Window Ops"
                 Mouse 3 FST N Popup "Window Ops"

            Pop-ups can be bound to keys through the use  of  the
            Key  built in.  Pop-ups can be operated without using
            the mouse by binding to keys and operating via the up
            arrow, down arrow, and enter keys.

         To bind a previously  defined  pop-up  menu  to  another
         menu, for use as a sub-menu:

           The following  example  defines  a  sub  menu,  "Quit-
           Verify"  and  binds it into a main menu, called "Root-
           Menu":

                AddToMenu Quit-Verify
                 + "Really Quit Fvwm?" Title
                 + "Yes, Really Quit"  Quit
                 + "Restart Fvwm2"     Restart fvwm2
                 + "Restart Fvwm 1.xx" Restart fvwm
                 + ""                  Nop
                 + "No, Don't Quit"    Nop

                AddToMenu RootMenu "Root Menu" Title
                 + "Open XTerm Window" Popup NewWindowMenu
                 + "Login as Root"     Exec exec xterm \
                                                 -fg green -T Root \
                                                 -n Root -e su -
                 + "Login as Anyone"   Popup AnyoneMenu
                 + "Remote Hosts"      Popup HostMenu
                 + ""                  Nop
                 + "X utilities"       Popup Xutils
                 + ""                  Nop
                 + "Fvwm Modules"      Popup Module-Popup
                 + "Fvwm Window Ops"   Popup Window-Ops
                 + ""                  Nop
                 + "Previous Focus"    Prev (*) Focus
                 + "Next Focus"        Next (*) Focus
                 + ""                  Nop
                 + "Refresh screen"    Refresh
                 + "Recapture screen"  Recapture
                 + ""                  Nop
                 + "Reset X defaults"  Exec xrdb -load \
                                       $HOME/.Xdefaults
                 + ""                  Nop
                 + ""                  Nop
                 + "Quit"              Popup Quit-Verify


        Popup differs from Menu in that pop-ups do not stay up if
        the user simply clicks.  These are Twm style popup-menus,
        which are a little hard  on  the  wrist.   Menu  provides
        Motif or Microsoft-Windows style menus which will stay up
        on a click action.  See menu for an  explanation  of  the
        interactive behaviour of menus.



     Prev (<font color="yellow">conditions</font color="yellow">) <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">
          Performs <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow"> (typically Focus) on the previous win-
          dow which satisfies all <font color="yellow">conditions</font color="yellow">.  Conditions are the
          same as for <font color="yellow">Next</font color="yellow">.



     Quit Exits fvwm, generally causing X to exit too.



     QuitScreen
          Causes fvwm to stop managing the screen  on  which  the
          command was issued.



     Raise
          Allows the user to raise a window.



     RaiseLower
          Alternately raises and lowers a window.



     Read <font color="yellow">filename</font color="yellow"> [ <font color="yellow">option</font color="yellow"> ]
          Causes fvwm  to  read  commands  from  the  file  named
          <font color="yellow">filename</font color="yellow">.   If  the  option  following  the filename is
          "Quiet", no message is produced  if  the  file  is  not
          found.



     Recapture
          Causes fvwm to recapture  all  of  its  windows.   This
          ensures  that the latest style parameters will be used.
          The recapture operation is visually disturbing.



     Refresh
          Causes all windows on the screen to redraw themselves.



     RefreshWindow
          Causes current (or chosen) window to redraw itself.



     Resize [ <font color="yellow">x</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">y</font color="yellow"> ]
          Allows the user to resize a  window.   If  called  from
          somewhere  in  a window or its border, then that window
          will be resized.  If called from the root  window  then
          the user will be allowed to select the target window.

          The operation can be aborted with Escape or by pressing
          any  mouse  button  (except button 1 which confirms the
          resize).

          If the optional arguments x and y  are  provided,  then
          the window will be resized so that its dimensions are <font color="yellow">x</font color="yellow">
          by <font color="yellow">y</font color="yellow">).  The units of x  and  y  are  percent-of-screen,
          unless  a letter "p" is appended to each coordinate, in
          which case the location is specified in pixels.



     Restart  <font color="yellow">WindowManagerName</font color="yellow">
          Causes <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> to restart itself if  WindowManagerName  is
          "fvwm2", or to switch to an alternate window manager if
          WindowManagerName is other than "fvwm2".  If the window
          manager  is  not  in your default search path, then you
          should use the full path name for <font color="yellow">WindowManagerName</font color="yellow">.

          This command should not have a  trailing  ampersand  or
          any  command  line arguments and should not make use of
          any environmental variables.  Of  the  following  exam-
          ples,  the  first two are sure losers, but the third is
          OK:

               Key F1 R N Restart fvwm &amp;
               Key F1 R N Restart $(HOME)/bin/fvwm
               Key F1 R N Restart /home/nation/bin/fvwm



     Scroll <font color="yellow">horizonal</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">vertical</font color="yellow">
          Scrolls the virtual desktop's  viewport  by  <font color="yellow">horizontal</font color="yellow">
          pages  in  the x-direction and <font color="yellow">vertical</font color="yellow"> pages in the y-
          direction.  Either or both  entries  may  be  negative.
          Both  horizontal  and  vertical values are expressed in
          percent of pages, so "Scroll 100 100" means  to  scroll
          down  and  left by one full page.  "Scroll 50 25" means
          to scroll left half a page and  down  a  quarter  of  a
          page.   The  scroll  function should not be called from
          pop-up menus. Normally, scrolling stops at the edge  of
          the desktop.

          If the horizontal and vertical percentages  are  multi-
          plied  by  1000  then scrolling will wrap around at the
          edge of the desktop.  If "Scroll 100000 0" is  executed
          over  and  over <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> will move to the next desktop page
          on each execution and will wrap around at the  edge  of
          the desktop, so that every page is hit in turn.

          If the letter "p" is appended to each coordinate  (hor-
          izontal  and/or  vertical), then the scroll amount will

          Sends an arbitrary string (no quotes required)  to  all
          modules  matching  <font color="yellow">modulename</font color="yellow">,  which may contain wild-
          cards.  This only makes sense if the module is  set  up
          to  understand  and  deal  with these strings though...
          Can be used for  module  to  module  communication,  or
          implementation of more complex commands in modules.


     SetAnimation <font color="yellow">milliseconds</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">delay</font color="yellow"> [ fractions-to-move-list ]
          Sets the time between frames and the list of fractional
          offsets  to  customize the animated moves of the <font color="yellow">Anima-</font color="yellow">
          <font color="yellow">tedMove</font color="yellow"> command and the animation of menus (if the menu
          style  is  set to animated).  If the <font color="yellow">fractions</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">to</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">move</font color="yellow">-
          <font color="yellow">list</font color="yellow"> is  omitted,  only  the  time  between  frames  is
          altered.   The fractions-to-move-list specifies how far
          the window should be offset at each successive frame as
          a fraction of the difference between the starting loca-
          tion and the ending location.  e.g.:

               SetAnimation 10 -.01 0 .01 .03 .08 .18 .3 \
                 .45 .6 .75 .85 .90 .94 .97 .99 1.0


          Sets the delay between frames to  10ms,  and  sets  the
          positions  of  the  16  frames of the animation motion.
          Notice that negative values are allowed, and in partic-
          ular  can  be  used  to  make  the  motion  appear more
          cartoonish, by briefly moving slightly in the  opposite
          direction  of  the main motion.  The above settings are
          the default.


     SetEnv <font color="yellow">varname</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">stringvalue</font color="yellow">
          Set an environment variable to a new value, similar  to
          shell's export or setenv command.  The variable and its
          value are inherited by processes  started  directly  by
          fvwm2.   This  can  be especially useful in conjunction
          with the FvwmM4 module; e.g.   "SetEnv  height  HEIGHT"
          will  make  the  FvwmM4-set variable "HEIGHT" usable by
          processes started by fvwm2 as the environment  variable
          "$height".   If  <font color="yellow">stringvalue</font color="yellow">  includes  whitespace, you
          should enclose it in quotes.



     SnapAttraction <font color="yellow">proximity</font color="yellow"> [ <font color="yellow">behavior</font color="yellow"> ]
          If during an interactive  move  the  window  (or  icon)
          comes within <font color="yellow">proximity</font color="yellow"> pixels of another the window (or
          icon) will be moved to make  the  borders  adjoin.  The
          default  of  -1  means that no snapping will happen.  A
          setting of 0 does indeed snap when the distance is zero
          pixels.   This is relevant when the <font color="yellow">SnapGrid</font color="yellow"> command is
          used.

          The <font color="yellow">behavior</font color="yellow"> argument is optional and may be set to one
          of the four following values:

          With <font color="yellow">All</font color="yellow"> both icons and windows snap to  other  windows
          and other icons.

          <font color="yellow">SameType</font color="yellow"> lets snap windows only to  other  windows  and
          icons only to other icons.

          With <font color="yellow">Windows</font color="yellow"> windows snap only to other windows.  Icons
          do not snap.

          Similarly with <font color="yellow">Icons</font color="yellow"> icons snap to only other icons and
          windows do not snap.

          The default  SnapAttraction  setting  for  behavior  is
          "All".


     SnapGrid <font color="yellow">x</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">grid</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">size</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">y</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">grid</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">size</font color="yellow">
          During an interactive move a window (or icon)  will  be
          positioned  such  that  its  location (top left corner)
          will be coincindent with the nearest grid  point.   The
          default <font color="yellow">x</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">grid</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">size</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">y</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">grid</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">size</font color="yellow"> setting are both 1,
          which is effectively no grid all.  An interactive  move
          with  both  <font color="yellow">SnapGrid</font color="yellow">  and <font color="yellow">SnapAttraction</font color="yellow"> in effect will
          result in the window being moved to be adjacent to  the
          nearest  window  border  (if  within snap proximity) or
          grid position.  In other words, the  window  will  move
          the shortest distance possible to satisfy both <font color="yellow">SnapGrid</font color="yellow">
          and <font color="yellow">SnapAttraction</font color="yellow">.  Note that the X and Y  coordinates
          are  not  coupled.   For  example, a window may snap to
          another window on the X axis while snapping to  a  grid
          point on the Y axis.


     Stick
          Makes a window sticky if it is not already  sticky,  or
          non-sticky if it is already sticky.


     Style <font color="yellow">windowname</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">options</font color="yellow">
          This command is intended to replace the old  fvwm  1.xx
          global   commands   NoBorder,   NoTitle,  StartsOnDesk,
          Sticky,  StaysOnTop,  Icon,  WindowListSkip,   Circula-

          StdForeColor, and StdBackColor with a  single  flexible
          and  comprehensive  window(s)  specific  command.  This
          command is used to set attributes of a window to values
          other  than  the  default  or to set the window manager
          default styles.

          <font color="yellow">windowname</font color="yellow"> can be a window's name, class,  or  resource
          string.  It can contain the wildcards * and/or ?, which
          are matched in the usual Unix  filename  manner.   They
          are searched in the reverse order stated, so that Style
          commands based on the name override  or  augment  those
          based  on  the  class,  which override or augment those
          based on the resource string.

          Note - windows that have no name (WM_NAME) are given  a
          name of "Untitled", and windows that don't have a class
          (WM_CLASS, res_class) are given Class =  "NoClass"  and
          those  that  don't have a resource (WM_CLASS, res_name)
          are given Resource = "NoResource".

          <font color="yellow">options</font color="yellow"> is a comma separated list  containing  some  or

          In the above list some options  are  listed  as  style-
          option/opposite-style-option.     The   opposite-style-
          option for entries that have them  describes  the  <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">
          default  behavior and can be used if you want to change
          the <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> default behavior.

          <font color="yellow">DecorateTransient</font color="yellow"> causes transient windows,  which  are
          normally  left  undecorated, to be given the usual <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">
          decorations (title bar, buttons, etc.). Note that  some
          pop-up  windows,  such  as  the  xterm  menus,  are not
          managed by the window manager and still do not  receive
          decorations.  <font color="yellow">NakedTransient</font color="yellow"> (the default) causes tran-
          sient windows not to be given the standard decorations.

          <font color="yellow">Icon</font color="yellow"> takes an (optional) unquoted string argument which
          is the icon bitmap or pixmap to use.

          <font color="yellow">IconBox</font color="yellow"> takes four numeric arguments or an X11 geometry
          string:

               IconBox l t r b

          or

               IconBox geometry


          Where l is the left coordinate, t  is  the  top,  r  is
          right  and  b  is bottom. Negative coordinates indicate
          distance from  the  right  or  bottom  of  the  screen.
          Perhaps easier to use is an X11 Geometry string:

               IconBox -80x200-1-1

          Which would place an 80 by 240  pixel  iconbox  in  the
          lower  right hand corner of the screen.  The iconbox is
          a region of the screen where fvwm attempts to put icons
          for any matching window, as long as they do not overlap
          other icons.  Multiple icon boxes  can  be  defined  as
          overflow areas.  When the first icon box is filled, the
          second one is filled.  All the icon boxes for one style


          must be defined in one command.  For example:

               Style "*" IconBox -80x200-1-1, \
                         IconBox 1000x70-1-1


          <font color="yellow">IconGrid</font color="yellow"> takes 2 numeric arguments greater than zero.

               IconGrid x y

          Icons are placed in an icon box by  stepping  thru  the
          icon  box  using  the x and y values for the icon grid,
          looking for a free space.  The default grid is 3  by  3
          pixels which gives a tightly packed appearance.  To get
          a more regular appearance use a grid larger  than  your
          largest  icon.   Currently  there  is no way to clip an
          icon to a maximum size.  An  IconGrid  definition  must
          follow the IconBox definition that it applies to:

               Style "*" IconBox -80x240-1-1, IconGrid 90 90


          <font color="yellow">IconFill</font color="yellow"> takes 2 arguments.

               IconFill Bottom Right

          Icons are placed in an icon box by  stepping  thru  the
          icon box using these arguments to control the direction
          the box is filled in.  By default the direction is left
          to  right, then top to bottom.  This would be expressed
          as:

               IconFill left bottom

          To fill an icon box in columns instead of rows, specify
          the  vertical  direction  (top  or  bottom) first.  The
          directions can be abbreviated or spelled  out  as  fol-
          lows:  "t",  "top",  "b",  "bot", "bottom", "l", "lft",
          "left", "r", "rgt", "right".   An  IconFill  definition
          must follow the IconBox definition that it applies to:

               Style "*" IconBox -80x240-1-1, IconFill b r


          <font color="yellow">MiniIcon</font color="yellow"> specifies a pixmap to  use  as  the  miniature
          icon  for the window.  This miniature icon can be drawn
          in a title-bar button (see  ButtonStyle),  and  can  be
          used by various fvwm modules (FvwmWinList, FvwmIconMan,
          and FvwmTaskBar). It takes the name of a pixmap  as  an
          argument.

          <font color="yellow">StartsOnDesk</font color="yellow"> takes a  numeric  argument  which  is  the
          desktop  number on which the window should be initially
          placed.   Note  that  standard  Xt  programs  can  also
          specify this via a resource (e.g. "-xrm '*Desk: 1'").

          <font color="yellow">StartsOnPage</font color="yellow"> takes 1, 2, or 3 numeric arguments. If one
          or three arguments are givem, the first (or only) argu-
          ment is the desktop number.   If  three  arguments  are
          given,  the 2nd and 3rd arguments identify the x,y page
          position on the virtual window. If  two  arguments  are
          given,  they specify the page position, and indicate no
          desk preference. If only one argument is given,  Start-
          sOnPage  functions exactly like StartsOnDesk. For those
          standard Xt programs which understand this  usage,  the
          starting desk/page can also be specified via a resource
          (e.g., "-xrm 'Fvwm.Page: 1 0 2'").

          StartsOnPage in conjunction with SkipMapping is a  use-
          ful  technique  when  you  want to start an app on some
          other page and  continue  with  what  you  were  doing,
          rather than waiting for it to appear.

          <font color="yellow">StaysOnTop</font color="yellow"> makes the window always try to stay  on  top
          of  the  other windows.  This might be handy for clocks
          or mailboxes that you would always like to be  visible.
          If  the window is explicitly lowered it will not try to
          force its way back to the top until  it  is  explicitly
          raised.  StaysPut (the default) allows the window to be
          obscured and stay that way.

          <font color="yellow">BorderWidth</font color="yellow"> takes a numeric argument which is the width
          of  the  border to place the window if it does not have
          resize-handles.

          <font color="yellow">HandleWidth</font color="yellow"> takes a numeric argument which is the width
          of  the  border  to  place  the  window if it does have
          resize-handles.

          <font color="yellow">Button</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">NoButton</font color="yellow"> take a numeric  argument  which  is
          the  number  of  the  title-bar  button  which is to be
          included/omitted.

          <font color="yellow">StickyIcon</font color="yellow"> makes the window sticky when its  iconified.
          It will deiconify on top the active desktop.

          <font color="yellow">MWMButtons</font color="yellow"> makes the Maximize  button  look  pressed-in
          when  the  window is maximized.  See the MWMButton flag
          in ButtonStyle for more information.

          <font color="yellow">MWMBorder</font color="yellow"> makes the 3-D bevel more closely match mwm's.

          <font color="yellow">MWMDecor</font color="yellow"> makes fvwm attempt to  recognize  and  respect
          the mwm decoration hints that applications occasionally
          use.

          <font color="yellow">MWMFunctions</font color="yellow">  makes  fvwm  attempt  to  recognize   and
          respect the mwm prohibited operations hints that appli-
          cations  occasionally  use.   HintOverride  makes  fvwm
          shade  out  operations  that mwm would prohibit, but it
          lets you perform the operation anyway.

          <font color="yellow">OLDecor</font color="yellow"> makes fvwm attempt to recognize and respect the
          olwm  and  olvwm  hints  that many older XView and OLIT
          applications use.

          <font color="yellow">Color</font color="yellow"> takes two arguments.  The first  is  the  window-
          label   text   color  and  the  second  is  the  window
          decoration's normal background color.  The  two  colors
          are  separated  with  a  slash.   If the use of a slash
          causes  problems  then  the  separate   ForeColor   and
          BackColor options can be used.

          <font color="yellow">UseDecor</font color="yellow"> accepts one argument:  the  name  of  a  decor
          created with AddToDecor.  If UseDecor is not specified,
          the "Default" decor is used.  Windows do  not  actually
          contain decors, but are always assigned to one.  If the
          decor is later modified with  AddToDecor,  the  changes
          will  be  visible for all windows which are assigned to
          it.  The decor for a  window  can  be  reassigned  with
          ChangeDecor.

          <font color="yellow">UseStyle</font color="yellow"> takes one arg, which is the  name  of  another
          style.   That  way  you can have unrelated window names
          easily inherit similar traits  without  retyping.   For
          example: 'Style "rxvt" UseStyle "XTerm"'.

          <font color="yellow">SkipMapping</font color="yellow"> tells fvwm not to switch to  the  desk  the
          window is on when it gets mapped initially (useful with
          StartsOnDesk or StartsOnPage).

          <font color="yellow">Lenience</font color="yellow"> instructs fvwm to ignore the convention in the
          ICCCM  which  states  that  if  an application sets the
          input field of the wm_hints structure to False, then it
          never  wants  the  window  manager to give it the input
          focus.  The only application that I know of which needs
          this  is  sxpm,  and that is a silly bug with a trivial
          fix and has no overall effect on  the  program  anyway.
          Rumor  is  that  some  older applications have problems
          too.

          <font color="yellow">ClickToFocus</font color="yellow"> instructs fvwm to give the  focus  to  the
          window  when  it is clicked in.  The default <font color="yellow">MouseFocus</font color="yellow">
          (or its alias <font color="yellow">FocusFollowsMouse</font color="yellow">) tells fvwm to give the
          window the focus as soon as the pointer enters the win-
          dow, and take it  away  when  the  pointer  leaves  the
          window. <font color="yellow">SloppyFocus</font color="yellow"> is similar, but doesn't give up the
          focus if the pointer leaves the window to pass over the
          root  window or a ClickToFocus window (unless you click
          on it, that is), which makes it possible  to  move  the
          mouse out of the way without losing focus.

          <font color="yellow">NoPPosition</font color="yellow"> instructs  fvwm  to  ignore  the  PPosition
          field when adding new windows.  Adherence to the PPosi-
          tion field is required for some  applications,  but  if
          you don't have one of those its a real headache.

          <font color="yellow">RandomPlacement</font color="yellow"> causes  windows  which  would  normally
          require  user  placement  to be automatically placed in
          ever-so-slightly random locations.  For the best of all
          possible  worlds  use  both  RandomPlacement and Smart-
          Placement.

          <font color="yellow">SmartPlacement</font color="yellow">  causes  windows  which  would  normally
          require  user placement to be automatically placed in a
          smart location - a location in which they do not  over-
          lap  any other windows on the screen.  If no such posi-
          tion can be found user placement  or  random  placement
          (if specified) will be used as a fall-back method.  For
          the best of all possible worlds use  both  RandomPlace-
          ment and SmartPlacement.

          An example:

               # Change default fvwm behavior to no title-
               # bars on windows! Also define a default icon.

          Note that all properties for a  window  will  be  OR'ed
          together.   In  the  above example "FvwmPager" gets the
          property StaysOnTop via an exact window name match  but
          also  gets  NoHandles,  Sticky, and WindowListSkip by a
          match to "Fvwm*".  It will get NoTitle by virtue  of  a
          match  to "*".  If conflicting styles are specified for
          a window, then the last style specified will be used.

          If the NoIcon attribute is set then the specified  win-
          dow  will  simply  disappear when it is iconified.  The
          window can be recovered through  the  window-list.   If
          Icon  is set without an argument then the NoIcon attri-
          bute is cleared but no icon is specified.   An  example
          which allows only the FvwmPager module icon to exist:

               Style "*" NoIcon
               Style "Fvwm Pager" Icon




     Title
          Does nothing.  This is used to insert a title line in a
          popup or menu.



     TitleStyle [ <font color="yellow">justification</font color="yellow"> ] [ <font color="yellow">height</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">num</font color="yellow"> ]
          Sets attributes for the title bar.  Justifications  can
          be  "Centered",  "RightJustified,"  or "LeftJustified."
          <font color="yellow">height</font color="yellow"> sets the title bar's height to an amount in pix-
          els.  Defaults are Centered and WindowFont height.  The
          <font color="yellow">height</font color="yellow"> parameter must be set after a WindowFont command
          since  WindowFont  resets the height to the default for
          the specified font.  Example:

               TitleStyle LeftJustified Height 24




     TitleStyle [ <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow"> ] [ <font color="yellow">style</font color="yellow"> ] [ -- [!]<font color="yellow">flag</font color="yellow"> ... ]
          Sets the style for the title bar.  <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow"> can be one  of
          "ActiveUp,"  "ActiveDown,"  or "Inactive."  If <font color="yellow">state</font color="yellow"> is
          omitted, then the style is added to  every  state.   If
          parentheses are placed around the style and flags, then
          multiple state  definitions  can  be  given  per  line.
          <font color="yellow">style</font color="yellow"> can be omitted so that flags can be set while not
          destroying the current style.

          If an "!" is prefixed to  any  <font color="yellow">flag</font color="yellow">,  its  behavior  is
          negated.   Valid flags for each state include "Raised,"
          "Flat," and "Sunk" (these are mutually exclusive).  The
          default is Raised.  See the note in ButtonStyle regard-
          ing the ActiveDown state.  Examples:

               TitleStyle ActiveUp HGradient 16 navy black
               TitleStyle ActiveDown (Solid red -- flat) \
                 Inactive (TiledPixmap wood.xpm)
               TitleStyle ActiveUp (-- Flat) ActiveDown  \
                 (-- Raised) Inactive (-- Flat)

          This sets the ActiveUp state to a horizontal  gradient,
          the  ActiveDown  state  to  solid red, and the Inactive
          state to a tiled wood pixmap.  Finally, ActiveUp is set
          to  look  flat,  while  ActiveDown  set to be sunk (the
          Raised flag for  the  ActiveDown  state  causes  it  to
          appear  Sunk  due to relief inversion), and Inactive is
          set to flat as well.  An example which sets  flags  for
          all states:

               TitleStyle -- flat

          For a flattened look:

               TitleStyle -- flat
               ButtonStyle All ActiveUp (-- flat) Inactive \
                 (-- flat)




     UpdateDecor [ <font color="yellow">decor</font color="yellow"> ]
          Updates  window  decorations.   <font color="yellow">decor</font color="yellow">  is  an  optional
          argument  which  specifies  the  <font color="yellow">decor</font color="yellow">  to  update.  If
          given, only windows which are assigned to that particu-
          lar <font color="yellow">decor</font color="yellow"> will be updated.  This command is useful, for
          instance, after a ButtonStyle,  TitleStyle  or  Border-
          Style  (possibly  used in conjunction with AddToDecor).
          Specifying an invalid  decor  results  in  all  windows
          being  updated.   This  command is less disturbing than
          Recapture, but does not affect window style options  as
          Recapture does.



     Wait <font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow">
          This built-in is intended to be used in <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">  functions
          only.  It causes execution of a function to pause until
          a new window name  <font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow">  appears.  <font color="yellow">Fvwm</font color="yellow">  remains  fully
          functional  during a wait.  This is particularly useful
          in the InitFunction if you are trying to start  windows
          on specific desktops:

               AddToFunc InitFunction
                + "I" exec xterm -geometry 80x64+0+0
                + "I" Wait xterm
                + "I" Desk 0 2
                + "I" Exec exec xmh -font fixed -geometry \
                      507x750+0+0
                + "I" Wait xmh
                + "I" Desk 0 0

          The above function starts an xterm on the current desk,
          waits for it to map itself, then switches to desk 2 and
          starts an xmh.  After the xmh  window  appears  control
          moves to desk 0.



     WarpToWindow <font color="yellow">x</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">y</font color="yellow">
          Warps the cursor to the associated window.  The parame-
          ters  x  and y default to percentage of window down and
          in from the upper left hand corner (or number of pixels
          down and in if 'p' is appended to the numbers).



     WindowFont [ <font color="yellow">fontname</font color="yellow"> ]
          Makes <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> use font <font color="yellow">fontname</font color="yellow">  instead  of  "fixed"  for
          window  title-bars.  To  reset this font to the default
          font (see <font color="yellow">DefaultFont</font color="yellow">) you may omit <font color="yellow">fontname</font color="yellow">.



     WindowId <font color="yellow">id</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">func</font color="yellow">
          The WindowId function is similar to the Next  and  Prev
          funcs,  except  that  it looks for a specific window <font color="yellow">id</font color="yellow">
          and runs the specified <font color="yellow">func</font color="yellow"> on it.

               WindowId 0x34567890 Raise
               WindowId 0x34567890 WarpToWindow 50 50

          Mostly this is useful for functions used with the  Win-
          dowList builtin.



     WindowList [ <font color="yellow">position</font color="yellow"> ] [ <font color="yellow">options</font color="yellow"> ] [ <font color="yellow">double</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">click</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow"> ]
          Generates a pop-up menu (and pops it up) in  which  the
          title  and geometry of each of the windows currently on
          the desk top are shown.  The geometry of iconified win-
          dows  is  shown in parenthesis.  Selecting an item from
          the window list pop-up menu will by default  cause  the
          interpreted  function WindowListFunc to be run with the
          window id of that window passed in as $0.   By  default
          the WindowListFunc looks like this:

               AddToFunc WindowListFunc
                + "I" WindowId $0 Iconify -1
                + "I" WindowId $0 FlipFocus
                + "I" WindowId $0 Raise
                + "I" WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 5p 5p

          You can Destroy the builtin WindowListFunc  and  create
          your own if these defaults do not suit you.

          The <font color="yellow">position</font color="yellow"> arguments are the same as  for  <font color="yellow">Menu</font color="yellow">.  The
          command <font color="yellow">double</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">click</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow"> will be invoked if the user
          double-clicks (or hits the key  rapidly  twice  if  the
          menu  is bound to a key) when bringing the window list.
          The double-click-action must be quoted if  it  consists
          of more than one word.

          The double-click-action is useful to define  a  default
          window  if  you have bound the window list to a key (or
          button) like this:

               Key Tab A M WindowList "Prev FlipFocus"

          Hitting Alt-Tab once it brings up the window  list,  if
          you  hit  it  twice  the  focus  is flipped between the
          current and the last focused window.

          The <font color="yellow">options</font color="yellow"> passed to WindowList can  be  "NoGeometry",
          "Function &lt;funcname&gt;", "Desk &lt;desknum&gt;", "CurrentDesk",
          "NoIcons", "Icons", "OnlyIcons", "NoNormal",  "Normal",
          "OnlyNormal",   "NoSticky",   "Sticky",   "OnlySticky",
          "NoOnTop",    "OnTop",    "OnlyOnTop",    "NoDeskSort",
          "UseIconName", "Alphabetic", "NotAlphabetic".

          (Note - normal means not iconic, sticky, or ontop)

          If you pass in a function via "Function &lt;funcname&gt;", $0
          is the window id:

               AddToFunc IFunc "I" WindowId $0 Iconify
               WindowList Function IFunc, NoSticky, \
                 CurrentDesk, NoIcons


          If you wanted to use the WindowList as an icon manager,
          you could invoke the following:

               WindowList OnlyIcons, Sticky, OnTop, Geometry

          (Note - the "Only" options  essentially  wipe  out  all
          other ones...)



     WindowsDesk <font color="yellow">arg1</font color="yellow"> [ <font color="yellow">arg2</font color="yellow"> ]
          Moves  the   selected   window   to   another   desktop
          (workspace, room).

          This command has been removed and must be  replaced  by
          <font color="yellow">MoveToDesk</font color="yellow">, the arguments for which are the same as for
          the <font color="yellow">Desk</font color="yellow"> command.  <font color="yellow">Note</font color="yellow">: You cannot simply  change  the
          name  of  the  command:  the syntax has changed. If you
          used "WindowsDesk n" to move a window to  desk  n,  you
          will have to change it to "MoveToDesk 0 n".



     WindowShade [ <font color="yellow">opt</font color="yellow"> ]
          Toggles the window shade feature  for  titled  windows.
          Windows  in  the shaded state only display a title bar.
          If <font color="yellow">opt</font color="yellow"> is not given, the window shade state is toggled.
          If  <font color="yellow">opt</font color="yellow"> is 1, the window is forced to the shaded state.
          If <font color="yellow">opt</font color="yellow"> is 2, then the window  is  forced  to  the  non-
          shaded  state.   Maximized  windows and windows without
          titles cannot be shaded.



     XORvalue <font color="yellow">number</font color="yellow">
          Changes the value with which bits are XOR'ed when doing
          rubber-band  window  moving  or resizing.  Setting this
          value is a trial-and-error process.

     +    Used to continue adding to the  last  specified  decor,
          function  or  menu.  See the discussion for AddToDecor,
          AddToFunc, and AddToMenu.





</PRE>
<H2>KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS</H2><PRE>
     All (I think) window manager  operations  can  be  performed
     from the keyboard so mouseless operation should be possible.
     In addition to scrolling around the virtual desktop by bind-
     ing  the Scroll built-in to appropriate keys, pop-ups, move,
     resize, and most other built-ins can be bound to keys.  Once
     a built-in function is started the pointer is moved by using
     the up, down, left, and right arrows, and the action is ter-
     minated by pressing return.  Holding down the shift key will
     cause the pointer movement to go in larger steps and holding
     down the control key will cause the cursor movement to go in
     smaller steps.  Standard emacs and vi cursor  movement  con-
     trols  (^n,  ^p,  ^f,  ^b,  and  ^j, ^k, ^h, ^l) can be used
     instead of the arrow keys.




</PRE>
<H2>SUPPLIED CONFIGURATION</H2><PRE>
     A sample configuration file, .fvwm2rc, is supplied with  the
     <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">  distribution.  It is well commented and can be used as
     a source of examples for <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> configuration.




</PRE>
<H2>USE ON MULTI-SCREEN DISPLAYS</H2><PRE>
     If the -s command line argument  is  not  given,  <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">  will
     automatically  start  up  on  every  screen on the specified
     display.  After <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> starts each screen is treated  indepen-
     dently.  Restarts of <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> need to be performed separately on
     each screen.  The use of EdgeScroll 0 0 is  strongly  recom-
     mended for multi-screen displays.

     You may need to quit on each screen to quit from the X  ses-
     sion completely.




</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
     DISPLAY
          Fvwm starts on this display unless the -<font color="yellow">display</font color="yellow">  option
          is given.

     FVWM_MODULEDIR
          Set by <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> to the directory  containing  the  standard
          <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> modules.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     As of fvwm 2.2 there were exactly 46.144 unidentified  bugs.
     Identified  bugs have mostly been fixed, though.  Since then
     12.25 bugs have been fixed.   Assuming  that  there  are  at
     least  10  unidentified  bugs for every identified one, that
     leaves us with 46.144 - 12.25 + 10 * 12.25 = 156.395 uniden-
     tified bugs.  If we follow this to its logical conclusion we
     will have an infinite number of unidentified bugs before the
     number  of  bugs  can  start to diminish, at which point the
     program will be bug-free.  Since this is a computer  program
     infinity  =  3.4028e+38  if  you  don't  insist  on  double-
     precision.  At the current rate of bug discovery  we  should
     expect  to  achieve this point in 4.27e+27 years.  I guess I
     better plan on passing this thing on to my children....

     Known bugs can be found in the BUGS file  in  the  distribu-
     tion,  in  the fvwm bug tracking system (accessible from the
     fvwm home page) and in the TO-DO list.

     Bug reports can be sent to the FVWM  workers'  mailing  list
     (see the FAQ).
