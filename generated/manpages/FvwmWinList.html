<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     FvwmWinList - the FVWM window list module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmWinList is spawned by fvwm, so no command  line  invoca-
     tion will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The FvwmWinList module provides a window  list  made  up  of
     buttons,  each corresponding to a window that FVWM is manag-
     ing.  Clicking on the buttons with any of  the  three  mouse
     buttons  will either do a default action or can be user con-
     figured.  Like the other  modules,  FvwmWinList  only  works
     when fvwm is used as the window manager.

<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>
     The FvwmWinList module is the original work of Mike Finger.

     Copyright 1994, Mike Finger. The author makes no  guarantees
     or warranties of any kind about the use of this module.  Use
     this modules at your own risk.   You  may  freely  use  this
     module  or  any portion of it for any purpose as long as the
     copyright is kept intact.



</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
     During initialization, <font color="yellow">FvwmWinList</font color="yellow"> will scan the same confi-
     guration  file  that  FVWM  used  during startup to find the
     options that pertain to it.  These options are discussed  in
     a later section.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
     FvwmWinList can be invoked by fvwm during initialization  by
     inserting the line 'Module FvwmWinList' in the .fvwmrc file.

     FvwmWinList can also be bound to a keystroke, mouse  button,
     or  menu  option  to  be  invoked  later, in this case using
     'Transient' as an argument will cause FvwmWinList to  resem-
     ble the built in window list.

     FvwmWinList must reside in a directory that is listed in the
     ModulePath option of FVWM for it to be executed by FVWM.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     The following options can be placed in the .fvwmrc file


     *FvwmWinList: Geometry {+-}&lt;<font color="yellow">X</font color="yellow">&gt;{+-}&lt;<font color="yellow">Y</font color="yellow">&gt;
          Specifies the location and gravity of  the  FvwmWinList
          window.  At the current time, size is not supported and
          FvwmWinList will resize itself as  buttons  are  added.
          If  the  NoAnchor option is not specified then the win-
          dows gravity corner will be anchored,  and  the  window
          will  grow  in  the  opposite  direction.  (i.e. If the
          geometry is specified -5-5,  that  is  SoutEastGravity.
          This  will  cause the window to draw up and to the left
          as windows are added)


     *FvwmWinList: Font <font color="yellow">font</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the font to be used for labeling the buttons.


     *FvwmWinList: Colorset <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the colorset to  use  for  the  buttons.  See
          FvwmTheme. Defaults to 0.


     *FvwmWinList: Fore <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the color to use for the button  names.  Can-
          cels *FvwmWinList: Colorset.


     *FvwmWinList: Back <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the color for the buttons. Cancels  *FvwmWin-
          List: Colorset.


     *FvwmWinList: FocusColorset <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the colorset to use for the  button  for  the
          window that has the input focus. Defaults to 1.


     *FvwmWinList: FocusFore <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the color to use for the button names for the
          window  that has the input focus. If omitted, the color
          from <font color="cyan">FvwmWinListFore</font color="cyan">  is  used.  Cancels  *FvwmWinList:
          FocusColorset.


     *FvwmWinList: FocusBack <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the color to use for the button for the  win-
          dow  that  has  the  input focus. If omitted, the color
          from <font color="cyan">FvwmWinListBack</font color="cyan">  is  used.  Cancels  *FvwmWinList:
          FocusColorset.


     *FvwmWinList: IconColorset <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the colorset to use for buttons  for  windows
          that are iconified. Defaults to 0.

     *FvwmWinList: IconFore <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the color to use for  the  button  names  for
          windows  that are iconified. If omitted, the color from
          <font color="cyan">FvwmWinListFore</font color="cyan"> is used.  Cancels  *FvwmWinList:  Icon-
          Colorset.


     *FvwmWinList: IconBack <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the color to use for the button  for  windows
          that are iconified. If omitted, the color from <font color="cyan">FvwmWin-</font color="cyan">
          <font color="cyan">ListBack</font color="cyan"> is used. Cancels *FvwmWinList: IconColorset.


     *FvwmWinList: DontDepressFocus
          By default FvwmWinList will show  the  button  for  the
          window  that  has  the  input focus as pressed in. This
          option disables that feature.


     *FvwmWinList: ButtonFrameWidth <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow">
          Specify the width of the 3D borders around the  buttons
          in FvwmWinList.


     *FvwmWinList: FollowWindowList
          Specifies that FvwmWinList will keep its  list  in  the
          same order as FVWM.  This is the order displayed by the
          "WindowList NoDeskSort" FVWM command.  This is not  the
          default  as  it  is  more  visually disturbing when the
          focus changes.


     *FvwmWinList: UseSkipList
          Tells FvwmWinList to not  show  the  windows  that  are
          listed  on  a  WindowListSkip line in the configuration
          file.


     *FvwmWinList: ShowCurrentDesk
          Specifies that only windows on  the  current  desk  are
          displayed.


     *FvwmWinList: NoAnchor
          By default, FvwmWinList will anchor the gravity  corner
          so  the  window  will  grow  in the opposite direction.
          This undoes that option, i.e. the  window  will  always
          grow  down.   Do  not  use  this  option  if a negative
          geometry was specified.


     *FvwmWinList: UseIconNames
          Tells FvwmWinList to use the icon name  of  the  window
          instead  of  the  full  window name.  This is useful to
          keep the width of the window small.


     *FvwmWinList: LeftJustify
          By default, FvwmWinList will center the  icon  text  in
          the  icon.  This option causes it to be justified flush
          with the left edge of the icon. This option  is  turned
          on when MiniIcons are used.


     *FvwmWinList: MinWidth <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow">

     *FvwmWinList: MaxWidth <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow">
          Specify the minimum and maximum widths that the buttons
          will shrink or grow to.  The buttons will normally size
          to fit the longest name, but certain applications  pro-
          duce icon titles that can easily fill the screen.  Set-
          ting these parameters constrains the size of  the  but-
          tons to be between the two values.  Setting them ident-
          ically will fix the size of the buttons.  Setting Max &lt;
          Min will have unpredictable results.


     *FvwmWinList: TruncateLeft
          If names  get  truncated  because  of  the  setting  of
          <font color="cyan">FvwmWinListMaxWidth</font color="cyan">,  they  will normally get truncated
          on the right, so only the start of the names are  visi-
          ble. Setting this resource will cause them to get trun-
          cated on the left, so that the end of names  are  visi-
          ble.  This  is  useful when the window title contains a
          directory and file name, for example.


     *FvwmWinList: Action <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">response</font color="yellow">
          Tells FvwmWinList to do <font color="yellow">response</font color="yellow"> when <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow">  is  done.
          The  currently  supported  <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow">s are: Click1, Click2,
          Click3 and so on.  By default  the  module  supports  3
          mouse  buttons, but it can be compiled to support more.
          The currently supported <font color="yellow">response</font color="yellow">s are any fvwm built-in
          commands,  including  modules  and functions.  Warning:
          The use of the former syntax that allowed to use  comma
          separated lists of commands is strongly discouraged due
          to synchronization problems with fvwm.  Please use com-
          plex  fvwm  functions instead (defined with the 'AddTo-
          Func' command of fvwm).


     *FvwmWinList: NoIconAction <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow">
          Tells FvwmWinList to do <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow"> is when a  NoIcon  style
          window   is   iconified   or   de-iconified.   Relevant
          coordinates are appended to <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow"> so that the icon can
          be  traced  to an FvwmWinList button. An example action
          is "*FvwmWinList: NoIconAction SendToModule FvwmAnimate
          animate".  A  blank  or  null action turns this feature
          off.
