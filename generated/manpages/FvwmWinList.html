       FvwmWinList - the FVWM window list module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmWinList is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invoca-
       tion will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The FvwmWinList module provides a window list made  up  of
       buttons,  each corresponding to a window that FVWM is man-
       aging.  Clicking on the buttons  with  any  of  the  three
       mouse  buttons  will  either do a default action or can be
       user configured.  Like the other modules, FvwmWinList only
       works when fvwm is used as the window manager.



</PRE>
<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>
       The  FvwmWinList  module is the original work of Mike Fin-
       ger.

       Copyright 1994, Mike Finger. The author makes  no  guaran-
       tees  or warranties of any kind about the use of this mod-
       ule.  Use this modules at your own risk.  You  may  freely
       use  this  module  or any portion of it for any purpose as
       long as the copyright is kept intact.



</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
       During initialization, <font color="yellow">FvwmWinList</font color="yellow"> will scan the same con-
       figuration  file that FVWM used during startup to find the
       options that pertain to it.  These options  are  discussed
       in a later section.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       FvwmWinList  can  be invoked by fvwm during initialization
       by inserting the line 'Module FvwmWinList' in the  .fvwmrc
       file.

       FvwmWinList  can  also be bound to a keystroke, mouse but-
       ton, or menu option to be  invoked  later,  in  this  case
       using 'Transient' as an argument will cause FvwmWinList to
       resemble the built in window list.

       FvwmWinList must reside in a directory that is  listed  in
       the  ModulePath  option  of  FVWM for it to be executed by
       FVWM.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The following options can be placed in the .fvwmrc file

              Specifies the location and gravity of the  FvwmWin-
              List window.  At the current time, size is not sup-
              ported and FvwmWinList will resize itself  as  but-
              tons  are  added.   If  the  NoAnchor option is not
              specified then the windows gravity corner  will  be
              anchored,  and the window will grow in the opposite
              direction.  (i.e.  If  the  geometry  is  specified
              -5-5, that is SoutEastGravity.  This will cause the
              window to draw up and to the left  as  windows  are
              added)


       *FvwmWinList: Font <font color="yellow">font</font color="yellow">
              Specifies the font to be used for labeling the but-
              tons.


       *FvwmWinList: Colorset <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow">
              Specifies the colorset to use for the buttons.  See
              FvwmTheme. Defaults to 0.


       *FvwmWinList: Fore <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
              Specifies  the  color  to use for the button names.
              Cancels *FvwmWinList: Colorset.


       *FvwmWinList: Back <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
              Specifies  the  color  for  the  buttons.   Cancels
              *FvwmWinList: Colorset.


       *FvwmWinList: FocusColorset <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow">
              Specifies  the  colorset  to use for the button for
              the window that has the input focus. Defaults to 1.


       *FvwmWinList: FocusFore <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
              Specifies the color to use for the button names for
              the window that has the input  focus.  If  omitted,
              the  color  from  <font color="cyan">FvwmWinListFore</font color="cyan">  is used. Cancels
              *FvwmWinList: FocusColorset.


       *FvwmWinList: FocusBack <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
              Specifies the color to use for the button  for  the
              window  that  has  the input focus. If omitted, the
              color  from  <font color="cyan">FvwmWinListBack</font color="cyan">   is   used.   Cancels
              *FvwmWinList: FocusColorset.


       *FvwmWinList: IconColorset <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow">


       *FvwmWinList: IconFore <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
              Specifies the color to use for the button names for
              windows  that  are iconified. If omitted, the color
              from <font color="cyan">FvwmWinListFore</font color="cyan"> is used. Cancels *FvwmWinList:
              IconColorset.


       *FvwmWinList: IconBack <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
              Specifies  the color to use for the button for win-
              dows that are iconified. If omitted, the color from
              <font color="cyan">FvwmWinListBack</font color="cyan">   is  used.  Cancels  *FvwmWinList:
              IconColorset.


       *FvwmWinList: DontDepressFocus
              By default FvwmWinList will show the button for the
              window that has the input focus as pressed in. This
              option disables that feature.


       *FvwmWinList: ButtonFrameWidth <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow">
              Specify the width of the 3D borders around the but-
              tons in FvwmWinList.


       *FvwmWinList: FollowWindowList
              Specifies  that  FvwmWinList  will keep its list in
              the same order as FVWM.  This  is  the  order  dis-
              played by the "WindowList NoDeskSort" FVWM command.
              This is not the default as it is more visually dis-
              turbing when the focus changes.


       *FvwmWinList: UseSkipList
              Tells  FvwmWinList to not show the windows that are
              listed on a WindowListSkip line in  the  configura-
              tion file.


       *FvwmWinList: ShowCurrentDesk
              Specifies that only windows on the current desk are
              displayed.


       *FvwmWinList: NoAnchor
              By default, FvwmWinList  will  anchor  the  gravity
              corner  so  the  window  will  grow in the opposite
              direction.  This undoes that option, i.e. the  win-
              dow  will always grow down.  Do not use this option
              if a negative geometry was specified.
              Tells FvwmWinList to use the icon name of the  win-
              dow  instead of the full window name.  This is use-
              ful to keep the width of the window small.


       *FvwmWinList: LeftJustify
              By default, FvwmWinList will center the  icon  text
              in the icon.  This option causes it to be justified
              flush with the left edge of the icon.  This  option
              is turned on when MiniIcons are used.


       *FvwmWinList: MinWidth <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow">

       *FvwmWinList: MaxWidth <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow">
              Specify  the  minimum  and  maximum widths that the
              buttons will shrink or grow to.  The  buttons  will
              normally  size to fit the longest name, but certain
              applications produce icon titles  that  can  easily
              fill  the  screen.   Setting  these parameters con-
              strains the size of the buttons to be  between  the
              two  values.  Setting them identically will fix the
              size of the buttons.  Setting Max &lt; Min  will  have
              unpredictable results.


       *FvwmWinList: TruncateLeft
              If  names  get  truncated because of the setting of
              <font color="cyan">FvwmWinListMaxWidth</font color="cyan">, they will normally  get  trun-
              cated  on the right, so only the start of the names
              are visible. Setting this resource will cause  them
              to  get  truncated  on the left, so that the end of
              names are visible. This is useful when  the  window
              title contains a directory and file name, for exam-
              ple.


       *FvwmWinList: Action <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">response</font color="yellow">
              Tells FvwmWinList to do  <font color="yellow">response</font color="yellow">  when  <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow">  is
              done.  The currently supported <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow">s are: Click1,
              Click2, Click3 and so on.  By  default  the  module
              supports 3 mouse buttons, but it can be compiled to
              support more.  The  currently  supported  <font color="yellow">response</font color="yellow">s
              are  any  fvwm built-in commands, including modules
              and functions.  Warning: The use of the former syn-
              tax  that  allowed  to use comma separated lists of
              commands is strongly discouraged  due  to  synchro-
              nization  problems  with  fvwm.  Please use complex
              fvwm functions instead (defined  with  the  'AddTo-
              Func' command of fvwm).


              Tells  FvwmWinList  to  do  <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow"> is when a NoIcon
              style window is iconified or de-iconified. Relevant
              coordinates are appended to <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow"> so that the icon
              can be traced to an FvwmWinList button. An  example
              action  is "*FvwmWinList: NoIconAction SendToModule
              FvwmAnimate animate". A blank or null action  turns
              this feature off.
