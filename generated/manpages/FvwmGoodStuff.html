<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     FvwmGoodStuff - the FVWM button panel module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmGoodStuff is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invoca-
     tion will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The FvwmGoodStuff module provides a button panel which  sits
     on the X terminal's root window. The user can press the but-
     tons at any time, and trigger invocation of a user-specified
     command by the window manager. FvwmGoodStuff only works when
     fvwm is used as the window manager.

     The button panel can be of any  configuration  or  geometry,
     and  can  have  monochrome  or  color icons to represent the
     actions which would be invoked.

     Note that this is the older version of FvwmButtons (decended
     from  fvwm 1.xx GoodStuff module), which was rewritten as of
     fvwm beta 2.0.42 to have more powerful  configuration  capa-
     bilities  (see it's man page).  If you don't want to exploit
     these new capabilities, or the new version gives  you  trou-
     bles, you may want to use this older module instead.

<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>

     this  module to the Window Manager, are all original work by

</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
     During initialization, <font color="yellow">FvwmGoodStuff</font color="yellow"> will search for a  con-
     figuration  file  which describes the button panel geometry,
     color, icons, and actions. The format of this files will  be
     described  later.  The  configuration  file  will be the one
     which fvwm used during its initialization.

     If the FvwmGoodStuff executable is linked to  another  name,
     ie  ln  -s  FvwmGoodStuff  TermStuff, or if FvwmGoodStuff is
     invoked with a parameter, ie Module FvwmGoodStuff TermStuff,
     then  another  module called TermStuff can be started with a
     completely  different  configuration   than   FvwmGoodStuff,
     simply   by   changing   the  keywords  FvwmGoodStuff???  to
     TermStuff???.  This way multiple button-bars can be used.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
     FvwmGoodStuff can be invoked by inserting the  line  'Module
     FvwmGoodStuff'  in the .fvwmrc file. This can be placed on a
     line by itself, if FvwmGoodStuff is  to  be  spawned  during
     fvwm's  initialization,  or  can be bound to a menu or mouse
     button or keystroke to invoke it  later.  Fvwm  will  search
     directory  specified  in the ModulePath configuration option
     to attempt to locate FvwmGoodStuff.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     The following options can be placed in the .fvwmrc file


     *FvwmGoodStuffGeometry <font color="yellow">geometry</font color="yellow">
          Specifies  the  FvwmGoodStuff  window  location  and/or
          size.  If the size is not specified, FvwmGoodStuff will
          auto-size itself in a reasonable manner.  The  geometry
          is a standard X11 window geometry specification.


     *FvwmGoodStuffFont <font color="yellow">font</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the font to be used for labeling the buttons.


     *FvwmGoodStuffRows <font color="yellow">rows</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the number of rows of buttons to be  created.
          If unspecified, 2 rows will be used.


     *FvwmGoodStuffColumns <font color="yellow">columns</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the  number  of  columns  of  buttons  to  be
          created.  If unspecified, the number of columns will be
          set to the number of buttons requested, divided by  the
          number of rows. If both the rows and columns are speci-
          fied, but  do  not  specify  as  many  buttons  as  are
          defined,  then  the users columns specification will be
          ignored.


     *FvwmGoodStuffFore <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the color for button  label  text  and  mono-
          chrome icons.


     *FvwmGoodStuffBack <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the color for the buttons.

     *FvwmGoodStuff[(<font color="yellow">w</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">x</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">h</font color="yellow">)] <font color="yellow">label</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">icon</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">
          Specifies  a  window  manager  built-in   command,   as
          described  in  the  fvwm man page, which should be exe-
          cuted when a button is pressed.  The label field is the
          text  which  will  be  written on the button.  The icon
          field specifies an X11 bitmap file or  XPM  color  icon
          file,  containing  the  icon  to display on the button.
          FvwmGoodStuff will search through the path specified in
          the  fvwm IconPath or PixmapPath configuration items to
          find the icon file.  If the optional (<font color="yellow">w</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">x</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">h</font color="yellow">) is  speci-
          fied,  then this button will be <font color="yellow">w</font color="yellow"> times the normal but-
          ton width and <font color="yellow">h</font color="yellow"> times the  normal  button  height.   If
          label  is  "-"  then  the  button  label  will  not  be
          displayed.

          If <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow"> is an fvwm Exec  command,  then  the  button
          will  remain  pushed  in  until  a window whose name or
          class matches the qouted  portion  of  the  command  is
          encountered.   This is intended to provide visual feed-
          back to the user that the action he has requested  will
          be  performed.  If the qouted portion contains no char-
          acters, then the button will pop out immediately.  Note
          that  users  can  continue pressing the button, and re-
          executing the command, even when it looks "pressed in."

          A single extension to the fvwm built-in command set  is
          provided.   A command of the form: '*FvwmGoodStuff junk
          clock.xpm  Swallow  "Clock"  Exec  rclock'  will  cause
          FvwmGoodStuff  to  spawn an rclock process, and capture
          the first window whose name or resource is "Clock", and
          display it in the button-bar.  This is handy for appli-
          cations like xclock, xbiff, and xload.  Modules can  be
          swallowed  by  specifying  the  module instead of 'Exec
          whatever',  like:  '*FvwmGoodStuff  -  foobar   Swallow
          "FvwmPager" FvwmPager 0 0'.

          NOTE: if you use xclock for this application, you  will
          want to specify xclock -padding 0.

<H2>SAMPLE CONFIGURATION</H2><PRE>
     The following are excepts from a .fvwmrc file which describe
     FvwmGoodStuff initialization commands:


     ##############################################################
     # Load any modules which should be started during
     # fvwm initialization
     ModulePath /usr/lib/X11/fvwm:/usr/bin/X11
     Module FvwmGoodStuff

     # Make FvwmGoodStuff title-bar-less, sticky, and give it an icon
     NoTitle FvwmGoodStuff
     Sticky FvwmGoodStuff
     Icon "FvwmGoodStuff"    toolbox.xpm

     ##############################################################
     ##############################################################
     #Definitions used by the modules
     *FvwmGoodStuffFore Black
     *FvwmGoodStuffBack #908090

     *FvwmGoodStuffGeometry -135-5
     *FvwmGoodStuffRows 1
     *FvwmGoodStuffFont -adobe-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

     *FvwmGoodStuff Resize  resize.xpm  Resize
     *FvwmGoodStuff Move    arrows2.xpm Move
     *FvwmGoodStuff Lower   Down        Lower
     *FvwmGoodStuff Raise   Up          Raise
     *FvwmGoodStuff Kill    bomb.xpm    Destroy

     *FvwmGoodStuff Dopey   rterm.xpm   Exec "big_win" xterm -T big_win -geometry 80x50
     *FvwmGoodStuff Snoopy  rterm.xpm   Exec "small_win" xterm -T small_wi
     *FvwmGoodStuff Xcalc   rcalc.xpm   Exec "Calculator" xcalc
     *FvwmGoodStuff XMag    magnifying_glass2.xpm    Exec "xmag" xmag
     *FvwmGoodStuff Mail    mail2.xpm   Exec "xmh" xmh
     *FvwmGoodStuff(4x1) - whatever SwallowModule "Fvwm Pager" FvwmPager 0 3


     The last line is a little tricky - it  spawns  an  FvwmPager
     module, and captures it to display in a quadruple width but-
     ton. Since "-" is used for the button label, the Pager  will
     be  resized  to  be  as  big as possible within the button's
     borders. "whatever", of course, is a non-existent icon file,
     and will be ignored by FvwmGoodStuff.
