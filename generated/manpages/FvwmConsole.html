       FvwmConsole - an FVWM command input interface



</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmConsole is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invoca-
       tion will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       FvwmConsole allows the user  to  type  fvwm  configuration
       commands  interactively,  and  have  them executed immedi-
       ately.  This tool is particularly useful for  testing  new
       configuration ideas, or for implementing temporary changes
       to your environment.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       FvwmConsole must be spawned as a module by fvwm.  FvwmCon-
       sole takes all <B>xterm(1)</B> options.

       FvwmConsole  can  be invoked by inserting the line 'Module
       FvwmConsole' in the .fvwm2rc file.  This can be placed  on
       a  line  by itself, if FvwmConsole is to be spawned during
       fvwm's initialization, or can be bound to a menu or  mouse
       button  or keystroke to invoke it later.  Fvwm will search
       directory specified in the ModulePath configuration option
       to attempt to locate FvwmConsole.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmConsole  uses  <B>xterm(1)</B>.   All resources set for xterm
       are inherited unless overridden by command line options.

              Module FvwmConsole -g 40x10 -fg black -bg green3

       A different terminal emulator can be  specified  with  the
       -terminal  option.   However,  only terminal programs that
       understand the options -name, -title and -e can be used.

              Module FvwmConsole -terminal rxvt

       Previous versions of FvwmConsole supported a -e option  to
       choose  a  different  front-end.   Although this option is
       still provided for backwards compatibility its use is dis-
       couraged unless you know exactly what you are doing.

              Module FvwmConsole -e FvwmConsoleC.pl

       (see <B>FvwmConsoleC.pl(1)</B>).

       Also X resources can be set in your ~/.Xdefaults file:





</PRE>
<H2>COMMAND EDITING</H2><PRE>
       There  are  a few options.  If the GNU readline library is
       available, it can be used.

       If Perl5 is installed, FvwmConsoleC.pl can be  used  as  a
       command  editor.  This can be accomplished by either copy-
       ing FvwmConsoleC.pl to fvwmlib directory  as  FvwmConsoleC
       or invoking FvwmConsole with -e option.  For example:

              Module FvwmConsole -e FvwmConsoleC.pl

       If  neither one is installed, a simple input reading func-
       tion which doesn't have editing capabilities is used.

       GNU readline and FvwmConsoleC.pl have some  frequent  used
       commands in common as default.  These commands are similar
       to emacs.  For more details, refer GNU  readline  man  and
       info pages, and FvwmConsoleC.pl man page.

              Cntl-A  - beginning of line
              Cntl-B  - previous char
              Cntl-D  - delete char
              Cntl-E  - end of line
              Cntl-F  - next char
              Cntl-H  - backspace
              Cntl-K  - erase to the end of line
              Cntl-N  - next line
              Cntl-P  - previous line
              Cntl-R  - search reverse
              Cntl-U  - delete line
              Meta-B  - previous word
              Meta-F  - next word
              Esc &lt;   - beginning of history
              Esc &gt;   - end of history



</PRE>
<H2>EXITING</H2><PRE>
       FvwmConsole  can  be stopped by entering the EOF character
       (usually CTRL-D).

       <font color="cyan">Note!</font color="cyan"> Do not use the "quit" command, as this  is  an  fvwm
       builtin:  typing  "quit"  at  the FvwmConsole command line
       will cause fvwm to exit.
