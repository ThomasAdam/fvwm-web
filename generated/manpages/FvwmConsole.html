<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     FvwmConsole - an FVWM command input interface



</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmConsole is spawned by fvwm, so no command  line  invoca-
     tion will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     FvwmConsole allows the user to type fvwm configuration  com-
     mands  interactively,  and  have  them executed immediately.
     This tool is particularly useful for testing new  configura-
     tion  ideas,  or  for implementing temporary changes to your
     environment.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
     FvwmConsole must be spawned as a module by  fvwm.   FvwmCon-
     sole takes all <B>xterm(1)</B> options, except -name and -title.

     FvwmConsole can be invoked by  inserting  the  line  'Module
     FvwmConsole'  in the .fvwm2rc file.  This can be placed on a
     line by itself, if  FvwmConsole  is  to  be  spawned  during
     fvwm's  initialization,  or  can be bound to a menu or mouse
     button or keystroke to invoke it later.   Fvwm  will  search
     directory  specified  in the ModulePath configuration option
     to attempt to locate FvwmConsole.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmConsole uses <B>xterm(1)</B>.  All resources set for xterm  are
     inherited unless overridden by command line options.

          Module FvwmConsole -g 40x10 -fg black -bg green3

     The option -e can be used to choose an alternate front-end:

          Module                  FvwmConsole                  -e
          /usr/X11/lib/fvwm2/FvwmConsoleC.pl

     (see <B>FvwmConsoleC.pl(1)</B>).

     Also X resources can be set in your ~/.Xdefaults file:

          FvwmConsole*VT100*geometry: 40x4
          FvwmConsole*font: 7x14




</PRE>
<H2>COMMAND EDITING</H2><PRE>
     There are a few options.  If the  GNU  readline  library  is
     available, it can be used.

     If Perl5 is installed, FvwmConsoleC.pl can be used as a com-
     mand  editor.   This  can  be accomplished by either copying
     FvwmConsoleC.pl to  fvwmlib  directory  as  FvwmConsoleC  or
     invoking FvwmConsole with -e option.  For example:

          Module                  FvwmConsole                  -e
          /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/FvwmConsoleC.pl

     If neither one is installed, a simple input reading function
     which doesn't have editing capabilities is used.

     GNU readline and FvwmConsoleC.pl  have  some  frequent  used
     commands  in  common as default.  These commands are similar
     to emacs. For more details, refer GNU readline man and  info
     pages, and FvwmConsoleC.pl man page.

          Cntl-A  - beginning of line
          Cntl-B  - previous char
          Cntl-D  - delete char
          Cntl-E  - end of line
          Cntl-F  - next char
          Cntl-H  - backspace
          Cntl-K  - erase to the end of line
          Cntl-N  - next line
          Cntl-P  - previous line
          Cntl-R  - search reverse
          Cntl-U  - delete line
          Meta-B  - previous word
          Meta-F  - next word
          Esc &lt;   - beginning of history
          Esc &gt;   - end of history



</PRE>
<H2>EXITING</H2><PRE>
     FvwmConsole can be stopped by entering the command  "killme"
     at the command line, or the EOF character (usually CTRL-D).

     <font color="cyan">Note!</font color="cyan"> Do not use the "quit" command,  as  this  is  an  fvwm
     builtin:  typing "quit" at the FvwmConsole command line will
     cause fvwm to exit.
