<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     FvwmSaveDesk - another FVWM desktop-layout saving module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmSaveDesk is spawned by fvwm, so no command line  invoca-
     tion will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     When called, this module will attempt to save  your  current
     desktop  layout as a definition of extra lines for the func-
     tion InitFunction into the  file  .<font color="yellow">fvwm2desk</font color="yellow">  in  your  home
     directory. As explain in the other documentation, this func-
     tion is called at startup of fvwm.  You have to include this
     file  in .<font color="yellow">fvwm2rc</font color="yellow"> after the definition of the Function Init-
     function.  You can do this by using  the  module  <font color="yellow">FvwmM4</font color="yellow">  or
     <font color="yellow">FvwmCpp</font color="yellow">.

     Your applications must supply certain hints to the X  window
     system.   <font color="yellow">Emacs</font color="yellow">  and  <font color="yellow">Netscape</font color="yellow">,  for  example,  does not, so
     FvwmSaveDesk can't get any information from it.

     Also, FvwmSaveDesk assumes that certain command line options
     are  globally accepted by applications, which may not be the
     case.

<H2>SETUP USING FVWMM4 MODULE</H2><PRE>
     The M4 Macro processor substitutes its macros  even  in  the
     middle of a word. Because of that you may have problems with
     predefined macros such as include or define. To  avoid  this
     the  GNU  M4 has an extra option to prefix all builtins with
     'm4_'. FvwmM4 can be called with option -m4-prefix and  then
     will  provide  the  option  -P  to M4.  I personally use the
     FvwmM4 module this way.

     fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 -m4-prefix -m4opt -I$HOME $HOME/.fvwm2rc"

     Simply add the following line to the end of .fvwm2rc:

     m4_include(`.fvwm2desk') .



</PRE>
<H2>SETUP USING FVWMCPP MODULE</H2><PRE>
     With the FVWMCPP you may have the problem that  the  prepro-
     cessor  directives starts with the comment character '#' and
     will complain about unknown directives, if you have comments
     in your .fvwm2rc.

     fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmCpp -C-I$HOME $HOME/.fvwm2rc"

     Simply add the following line to the end of .fvwm2rc:
     #include ".fvwm2desk"



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
     FvwmSaveDesk can be invoked by adding it to a menu or  bind-
     ing it to a mouse button or key stroke in the .<font color="yellow">fvwm2rc</font color="yellow"> file.
     Fvwm will search directory specified in the ModulePath  con-
     figuration option to locate FvwmSaveDesk.

     To insert it to a menu, add the line

     +    "Save Desktop" Module FvwmSaveDesk

     to the menu definition.  I thing binding it to a mouse  but-
     ton  is  not very useful, but you can do that, by adding for
     example this line.

     Mouse 3        R    CS   Module FvwmSaveDesk

     Than FvwmSaveDesk will be called if you hit the right  mouse
     button  on  the root window while holding the shift and con-
     trol button down.

     You can bind FvwmSaveDesk to a function key F10 for  example
     you have to insert the following line:

     Key  F10  A    Module FvwmSaveDesk

     I personally add it as a Button to the module FvwmButtons:

     *FvwmButtons SaveDesc desk.xpm   Module FvwmSaveDesk
