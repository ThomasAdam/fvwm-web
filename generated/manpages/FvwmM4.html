       FvwmM4 - the FVWM  M4 pre-processor


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmM4  is  spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation
       will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       When called, this module will attempt to have M4  pre-pro-
       cess  the  file specified in its invocation, and then have
       fvwm read the resulting file.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       FvwmM4 can be invoked by inserting the  line  'FvwmM4'  in
       the  .fvwm2rc  file.  It can also be called from a menu or
       mouse binding.  If the user wants his entire .fvwm2rc file
       pre-processed with FvwmM4, then fvwm should be invoked as:


            fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc"


       Note that the argument to  the  option  "-cmd"  should  be
       enclosed  in  quotes, and no other quoting should be used.
       For example, a typical invocation might be:


            fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 -m4-squote { -m4-equote } .fvwm2rc"


       Some options can be specified on the command line:

       -m4-prefix
              I think this makes all the  m4  directives  require
              the prefix "m4_".


       -m4opt <font color="yellow">option</font color="yellow">
              Lets  you  pass  an  option to the m4 program.  Not
              really needed as any unknown options will be passed
              on automatically.


       -m4-squote <font color="yellow">character</font color="yellow">
              Lets  you change the m4 start-of-quote character to
              <font color="yellow">character</font color="yellow">.


       -m4-equote <font color="yellow">character</font color="yellow">
              Lets you change the m4  end-of-quote  character  to
              <font color="yellow">character</font color="yellow">.
              Instead of invoking "m4", fvwm will invoke <font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow">.


       -outfile <font color="yellow">filename</font color="yellow">
              Instead  of  creating  a random unique name for the
              temporary file for the preprocessed rc  file,  this
              option  will let you specify the name of the tempo-
              rary file it will create.  Please note that  FvwmM4
              will  attempt to remove this file before writing to
              it, so don't point it at anything important even if
              it has read-only protection.


       -debug Causes  the  temporary  file  create  by  m4  to be
              retained. This file is usually called  "/tmp/fvwmr-
              cXXXXXX"


       -lock  If  you  want  to use this option you need to start
              FvwmM4 with ModuleSynchronous. This  option  causes
              fvwm  to  wait that the pre-process finish and that
              FvwmM4 asks fvwm to  Read  the  pre-processed  file
              before continuing. This may be useful at startup if
              you use a session manager as Gnome. Also,  this  is
              useful  if  you want to process and run a Form in a
              fvwm function.


       -noread
              Causes the pre-processed file to  be  not  read  by
              fvwm.  Useful  to  pre-process  a FvwmScript script
              with FvwmM4.




</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmM4 defines some values for use  in  the  pre-processor
       file:


       TWM_TYPE
              Always set to "fvwm".

       SERVERHOST
              The name of the machine running the X Server.

       CLIENTHOST
              The name of the machine running fvwm.

       HOSTNAME
              The hostname of the machine running fvwm. Generally
              the same as CLIENTHOST.

       USER   The name of the person running fvwm.

       HOME   The home directory of the person running fvwm.

       VERSION
              The X11 version.

       REVISION

              The X server release number.

       SCREEN The screen number.

       WIDTH  The screen width in pixels.

       HEIGHT The screen height in pixels.

       X_RESOLUTION
              Some distance/pixel measurement for the  horizontal
              direction, I think.

       Y_RESOLUTION
              Some  distance/pixel  measurement  for the vertical
              direction, I think.

       PLANES Number of color planes for the X server display

       BITS_PER_RGB
              Number of bits in each rgb triplet.

       CLASS  The X11 default visual class, e.g. PseudoColor.

       COLOR  Yes or No, Yes if the default visual class is  nei-
              ther StaticGrey or GreyScale.

       FVWM_CLASS

              Color.

       FVWM_COLOR
              Yes or No, Yes if the FVWM_CLASS is neither Static-
              Grey or GreyScale.

       OPTIONS

       FVWM_MODULEDIR
              The directory where fvwm looks for .fvwmrc and mod-
              ules by default, as determined at compile time.

       FVWM_USERDIR
              The value of $FVWM_USERDIR.

       SESSION_MANAGER
              The  value  of  $SESSION_MANAGER. Undefined if this
              variable is not set.

       FvwmM4 is the result of a random bit mutation  on  a  hard
       disk,  presumably  a  result of a  cosmic-ray or some such
       thing.
