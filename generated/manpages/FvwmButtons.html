<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     FvwmButtons - the FVWM buttonbox module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     FvwmButtons is spawned by fvwm, so no command  line  invoca-
     tion will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The FvwmButtons module provides a window  of  buttons  which
     sits on the X terminal's root window. The user can press the
     buttons at any time,  and  trigger  invocation  of  a  user-
     specified  command  by  the window manager. FvwmButtons only
     works when fvwm is used as the window manager.

     The buttonbox can be of any configuration or  geometry,  and
     can  have monochrome or color icons to represent the actions
     which would be invoked.



</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
     During initialization, <font color="yellow">FvwmButtons</font color="yellow"> will search for a  confi-
     guration file which describes the buttonbox geometry, color,
     icons, and  actions.  The  format  of  this  files  will  be
     described  later.  The  configuration  file  will be the one
     which fvwm used during its initialization.

     To use FvwmButtons with  several  different  configurations,
     you can invoke FvwmButtons with an optional parameter, which
     it will use as its name  instead  (e.g  "Module  FvwmButtons
     SomeButtons").  SomeButtons will then read only the lines in
     the configuration file starting with "*SomeButtons", and not
     the lines belonging to FvwmButtons.

     You can also specify an optional configuration file  to  use
     instead  of the default fvwm configuration file, by giving a
     second argument which is a filename. This will override  the
     setting "*FvwmButtonsFile", see below.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
     FvwmButtons can be invoked by  inserting  the  line  'Module
     FvwmButtons'  in  the .fvwmrc file. This should be placed in
     the InitFunction if FvwmButtons  is  to  be  spawned  during
     fvwm's  initialization,  or  can be bound to a menu or mouse
     button or keystroke to invoke it  later.  Fvwm  will  search
     directory  specified  in the ModulePath configuration option
     to attempt to locate FvwmButtons.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     The following options int the .fvwmrc file are understood by
     FvwmButtons:

     *FvwmButtonsBack <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the  background  color  for  the  buttons.  A
          relief  and a shadow color will also be calculated from
          this.

     *FvwmButtonsBoxSize <font color="yellow">algorithm</font color="yellow">
          This option specifies how serious FvwmButtons takes the
          Rows  and  Colums options (see below). It can be one of
          <font color="yellow">dumb</font color="yellow">, <font color="yellow">fixed</font color="yellow"> or <font color="yellow">smart</font color="yellow">.  If fixed is given and both  Rows
          and  Columns  are  specified  and non-zero, FvwmButtons
          will use exactly this numbers of rows  and  columns  of
          button.  If the box is too small to accomodate all but-
          tons the module  will  fail.  Using  the  smart  option
          FvwmButtons is intelligent enough to enlarge the box so
          all buttons have a chance to fit. The number of columns
          is increased to at least the width of the widest button
          and new rows are added until all buttons can be placed.
          For  best  tolerance of configuration of errors use the
          smart option.

     *FvwmButtonsColumns <font color="yellow">columns</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the  number  of  columns  of  buttons  to  be
          created.  If unspecified, the number of columns will be
          set to the number of buttons requested, divided by  the
          number of rows. If both the rows and columns are speci-
          fied, but  do  not  specify  as  many  buttons  as  are
          defined,  then  the users columns specification will be
          ignored unless the value <font color="yellow">fixed</font color="yellow"> was gived to the <font color="yellow">BoxSize</font color="yellow">
          option (see there).

     *FvwmButtonsFile <font color="yellow">filename</font color="yellow">
          Specifies that the configuration  for  this  button  is
          found in the file <font color="yellow">filename</font color="yellow">, which will have to be given
          with full pathname, or  is  assumed  to  be  in  fvwm's
          startup  directory.  The  configuration  file is in the
          same format as fvwm's configuration file, but each line
          is  read as if prefixed by "*FvwmButtons". Comments are
          given by starting a line with "#", line continuation is
          done by ending a line with a "\".

     *FvwmButtonsFont <font color="yellow">font</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the font to be used for labeling the buttons,
          or <font color="yellow">None</font color="yellow">.

     *FvwmButtonsFore <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the color used  for  button  label  text  and
          monochrome icons.

     *FvwmButtonsFrame <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the width of the relief around  each  button.
          If  this is given as a negative number, the relief will
          at all times be the inverse of the  normal  relief.  In
          effect,  you  will get a sunken button, which is raised
          when activated.

     *FvwmButtonsGeometry <font color="yellow">geometry</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the FvwmButtons  window  location.  The  size
          should  not  be specified, as FvwmButtons automatically
          chooses a size which  gracefully  accomodates  all  its
          buttons. The geometry is a standard X11 window geometry
          specification.

     *FvwmButtonsPadding <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">height</font color="yellow">
          The amount of free space between the relief of the but-
          ton  and its contents is normally 2 pixels to the sides
          and 4 pixels above and below, except for swallowed win-
          dows  and  containers,  which  are  not  padded at all,
          unless given specific orders.  This  setting  specifies
          the  default horizontal padding to be <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow"> pixels, and
          the vertical padding to be <font color="yellow">height</font color="yellow"> pixels.

     *FvwmButtonsPanel <font color="yellow">title</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the title of a panel. All following *FvwmBut-
          tons configuration commands up to the next *FvwmButton-
          sPanel line refer to the panel.

     *FvwmButtonsPixmap <font color="yellow">pixmapfile</font color="yellow">
          Specifies a background pixmap to use.   Specify  "none"
          for a transparent background.

     *FvwmButtonsRows <font color="yellow">rows</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the number of rows of buttons to be  created.
          If unspecified, 2 rows will be used.

     *FvwmButtons(<font color="yellow">options</font color="yellow">) [<font color="yellow">title</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">icon</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">]
          Specifies the contents of a button  in  the  buttonbox.
          The  following  <font color="yellow">options</font color="yellow">,  separated  by  commas or whi-
          tespace, can be given a button:

       <font color="yellow">geometry</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the size and position of  the  button  within
          the FvwmButtons window or container. The button will be
          <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow"> times the normal button width  and  <font color="yellow">height</font color="yellow">  times
          the  normal  button  height.  If values for <font color="yellow">x</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">y</font color="yellow"> are
          given, the button is placed x (y) button units from the
          left  (top) of the container if x (y) is positive and x
          (y) units from the right (bottom) if x (y) is negative.
          The geometry is a standard X11 window geometry specifi-
          cation. Buttons with position arguments (x and  y)  are
          placed before thos without them. If two or more buttons
          are forced to overlap by this, FvwmButton exits with an
          error message.

       Action [(<font color="yellow">options</font color="yellow">)] <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">
          Specifies an fvwm command to be executed when the  but-
          ton  is activated by pressing return or a mouse button.
          The <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow"> needs to be quoted if it contains  a  comma
          or a closing parenthesis. The current options are:

          Mouse <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow"> - this action is only executed for mouse button
          <font color="yellow">n</font color="yellow">.   One  actions can be defined for each mouse button,
          in addition to the general action.

       Back <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the background color to be used drawing  this
          box.  A  relief  color  and a shadow color will also be
          calculated from this.

       Center
          The contents of the button is centered on  the  button.
          This  is  the  default  but  may  be changed by <font color="yellow">Left</font color="yellow"> or
          <font color="yellow">Right</font color="yellow">.

       Container [(<font color="yellow">options</font color="yellow">)]
          Specifies that this button  will  contain  a  miniature
          buttonbox,   more  or  less  equivalent  to  swallowing
          another FvwmButtons module. The options are the same as
          can  be  given for a single button, but they affect all
          the contained buttons. Options available for  this  use
          are  <font color="yellow">Back</font color="yellow">,  <font color="yellow">Font</font color="yellow">,  <font color="yellow">Fore</font color="yellow">,  <font color="yellow">Frame</font color="yellow">  and <font color="yellow">Padding</font color="yellow">. Flags for
          Title and Swallow options can be set with  <font color="yellow">Title</font color="yellow">(<font color="yellow">flags</font color="yellow">)
          and  <font color="yellow">Swallow</font color="yellow">(<font color="yellow">flags</font color="yellow">).   You  should  also specify either
          "Columns <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow">" or "Rows <font color="yellow">height</font color="yellow">", or "Rows 2"  will  be
          assumed for purpose of arranging the buttons inside the
          container. For an example, see the <font color="yellow">Sample</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">configuration</font color="yellow">
          section.

          The container button itself  (separate  from  the  con-
          tents)  can take format options like <font color="yellow">Frame</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">Padding</font color="yellow">,
          and commands can be bound to it.  This  means  you  can
          make a sensitive relief around a container, like

            *FvwmButtons(2x2, Frame 5, Padding 2 2, Action Beep,\
                Container(Frame 1))

          Typically you will want to at least give the  container
          a size setting <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow">x<font color="yellow">height</font color="yellow">.


       End
          Specifies that no more  buttons  are  defined  for  the
          current  container,  and further buttons will be put in
          the container's parent. This option should be given  on
          a line by itself, i.e

            *FvwmButtons(End)

       Font <font color="yellow">fontname</font color="yellow">
          Specifies that the font <font color="yellow">fontname</font color="yellow">  is  to  be  used  for
          labeling this button.

       Fore <font color="yellow">color</font color="yellow">
          Specifies a color of the title and monochrome icons  in
          this button.

       Frame <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow">
          The relief of the button will be <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow"> pixels wide.  If
          <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow"> is given as a negative number, the relief will at
          all times be the inverse  of  the  normal  relief.   In
          effect,  you  will get a sunken button, which is raised
          when activated.

       Icon <font color="yellow">filename</font color="yellow">
          The name of an X11 bitmap file or XPM color icon  file,
          containing  the icon to display on the button. FvwmBut-
          tons will search through the path specified in the fvwm
          IconPath  or PixmapPath configuration items to find the
          icon file.

       Left
          The contents of the button will be aligned to the left.
          The default is to center the contents on the button.

       NoSize
          This option specifies that this button will not be con-
          sidered  at all when making the initial calculations of
          buttonsizes. Useful for the odd button that gets just a
          couple of pixels to large to keep in line, and therefor
          blows up your whole buttonbox. "NoSize"  is  equivalent
          to "Size 0 0".

       Padding <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">height</font color="yellow">
          The amount of free space between the relief of the but-
          ton  and its contents is normally 2 pixels to the sides
          and 4 pixels above and below, except for swallowed win-
          dows and containers, which are by default not padded at
          all.  This option sets the horizontal padding to  <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow">
          and the vertical padding to <font color="yellow">height</font color="yellow">.

       Panel [ (<font color="yellow">direction</font color="yellow">) ] <font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow">
          Pop up a panel in  the  specified  <font color="yellow">direction</font color="yellow">  from  the
          invoking   button.   A   position  set  with  *FvwmBut-
          tonsGeometry is taken as  a  relative  offset  to  this
          position.  <font color="yellow">direction</font color="yellow"> may be "up" (the default), "left",
          "down" od "right". The panel is a  button  bar  itself.
          See  <font color="yellow">FvwmButtonsPanel</font color="yellow">.  To  get the panel at a specific
          place on the screen use  "geometry"  in  place  of  the
          direction.  The  *FvwmButtonsGeometry line will then be
          treated as a normal X geometry specification.

       Right
          The contents of the  button  will  be  aligned  to  the
          Right.  The  default  is  to center the contents on the
          button.

       Size <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">height</font color="yellow">
          Specifies that the contents of this button will require
          <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow">   by  <font color="yellow">height</font color="yellow">  pixels,  regardless  of  what  size
          FvwmButtons calculates from the icon and the  title.  A
          buttonbar with only swallowed windows will not get very
          large without this  option  specified,  as  FvwmButtons
          does  not  consider  sizes for swallowing buttons. Note
          that this option gives the minimum space assured; other
          buttons  might  require  the  buttonbox  to  use larger
          sizes.

       Swallow [(<font color="yellow">flags</font color="yellow">)] <font color="yellow">hangon</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">
          Causes FvwmButtons to execute <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">, and when a  win-
          dow  matching  the  name <font color="yellow">hangon</font color="yellow"> appears, it is captured
          and swallowed into this button.  An example:

            *FvwmButtons(Swallow XClock 'Exec xclock &amp;')

          will  take  the  first  window  whose  name,  class  or
          resource  is  "XClock"  and  display  it in the button.
          Modules can  be  swallowed  by  specifying  the  module
          instead of 'Exec whatever', like:

            *FvwmButtons(Swallow "FvwmPager" "FvwmPager 0 0")

          The flags that can be given to swallow are:

          NoClose / Close - Specifies whether the swallowed  pro-
          gram  in this button will be unswallowed or closed when
          FvwmButtons exit cleanly.  "NoClose"  can  be  combined
          with  "UseOld"  to have windows survive restart of win-
          dowmanager. The default setting is "Close".

          NoHints / Hints -  Specifies  whether  hints  from  the
          swallowed  program  in  this  button will be ignored or
          not, useful in forcing a window to resize itself to fit
          its button. The default value is "Hints".

          NoKill / Kill - Specifies whether the swallowed program
          will be closed by killing it or by sending a message to
          it. This can be useful in ending programs that  doesn't
          accept  window  manager  protocol. The default value is
          "NoKill".  This has no effect if  "NoClose"  is  speci-
          fied.
          NoRespawn / Respawn - Specifies whether  the  swallowed
          program  is  to be respawn if it dies.  If "Respawn" is
          specified, the program will be respawned using the ori-
          ginal  <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">.  Use this option with care, the program
          might have a very legitimate reason to die.

          NoOld / UseOld - Specifies whether the button will  try
          to  swallow an existing window matching the <font color="yellow">hangon</font color="yellow"> name
          before spawning one itself with <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">.   The  default
          value  is "NoOld".  "UseOld" can be combined with "NoK-
          ill" to have windows survive restart of  windowmanager.
          If  you  want FvwmButtons to swallow an old window, and
          not spawn one itself if failing,  let  the  <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">  be
          "Nop":

            *FvwmButtons(Swallow (UseOld) "Console" Nop)

          If you want to be able to start it yourself, combine it
          with an action:

            *FvwmButtons(Swallow (UseOld) "Console" Nop, \
                         Action `Exec "Console" console &amp;`)

          NoTitle / UseTitle - Specifies whether the title of the
          button  will be taken from the swallowed window's title
          or not. If "UseTitle" is given, the title on the button
          will change dynamically to reflect the window name. The
          default is "NoTitle".


       Title [(<font color="yellow">options</font color="yellow">)] <font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the title which will be written on  the  but-
          ton.   Whitespace can be included in the title by quot-
          ing it.  If a title at any time is to long for its but-
          tons,  characters are chopped of one at a time until it
          fits.  If <font color="yellow">justify</font color="yellow"> is "Right", the head is removed, oth-
          erwise its tail is removed.  These <font color="yellow">options</font color="yellow"> can be given
          to Title:

          Center - The title will be centered horizontally.  This
          is the default.

          Left - The title will be justified to the left side.

          Right - The title will be justified to the right side.

          Side - This will cause the title to appear on the right
          hand  side  of any icon or swallowed window, instead of
          below it which is the default.  If you use small icons,
          and  combine this with the "Left" option, you can get a
          look similar to fvwm's menus.

     Legacy fields [<font color="yellow">title</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">icon</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">]
          These fields are kept for compatibility  with  previous
          versions  of FvwmButtons, and their use is discouraged.
          The <font color="yellow">title</font color="yellow"> field is similar to the option Title <font color="yellow">name</font color="yellow">. If
          the  title  field  is  "-", no title will be displayed.
          The <font color="yellow">icon</font color="yellow"> field is similar to the option Icon  <font color="yellow">filename</font color="yellow">.
          If  the  icon  field  is "-" no icon will be displayed.
          The <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow"> field is similar to the option Action  <font color="yellow">com-</font color="yellow">
          <font color="yellow">mand</font color="yellow"> or alternatively Swallow "<font color="yellow">hangon</font color="yellow">" <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">.

     The <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">
          Any fvwm command  is  recognized  by  FvwmButtons.  See
          <B>fvwm(1)</B>  for  more info on this. The Exec command has a
          small extension when used in  Actions,  its  syntax  is
          here:

            Exec ["hangon"] command

          When FvwmButtons finds such an Exec command, the button
          will  remain  pushed  in  until  a window whose name or
          class matches the qouted  portion  of  the  command  is
          encountered.  This  is intended to provide visual feed-
          back to the user that the action he has requested  will
          be performed. If the qouted portion contains no charac-
          ters, then the button will pop out  immediately.   Note
          that  users  can  continue pressing the button, and re-
          executing the command, even when it looks "pressed in."

     Quoting
          Any string which contains whitespace  must  be  quoted.
          Contrary to earlier versions commands no longer need to
          be quoted. In this case any quoting character  will  be
          passed on to the application untouched. Only commas ','
          and closing parentheses ')' have to be quoted inside  a
          command.   Quoting  can  be  done with any of the three
          quotation characters; single quote:

            'This is a "quote"',

          double quote:

            "It's another `quote'",

          and backquote:

            `This is a strange quote`.

          The backquoting is purposeful if you use a preprocessor
          like  FvwmCpp  and  want  it to get into your commands,
          like this:

            #define BG gray60
            *FvwmButtons(Swallow "xload" `Exec xload -bg BG &amp;`)

          Furthermore a single character can  be  quoted  with  a
          preceding backslash ''.

<H2>ARRANGEMENT ALGORITHM</H2><PRE>
     FvwmButtons tries to arrange its buttons as best it can,  by
     using recursively, on each container including the buttonbox
     itself, the following algorithm.

     Getting the size right
          First it calculates the number of button unit areas  it
          will need, by adding the width times the height in but-
          tons of each button. Containers are for the moment con-
          sidered  a  normal button.  Then it considers the given
          <font color="yellow">rows</font color="yellow"> and <font color="yellow">columns</font color="yellow"> arguments.  If the number of  rows  is
          given,  it  will calculate how many columns are needed,
          and stick to that, unless <font color="yellow">columns</font color="yellow"> is larger,  in  which
          case you will get some empty space at the bottom of the
          buttonbox.  If the number of columns is given, it  cal-
          culates  how many rows it needs to fit all the buttons.
          If neither is given, it assumes you want two rows,  and
          finds  the number of columns from that.  If the BoxSize
          option is set to <font color="yellow">smart</font color="yellow"> at least the height/width of the
          tallest/widest  button  is  used  while the <font color="yellow">fixed</font color="yellow"> value
          prevents the box from getting resized if both <font color="yellow">rows</font color="yellow">  and
          <font color="yellow">colums</font color="yellow"> have been set to non-zero.

     Shuffling buttons
          Now it has a large enough area to place the buttons in,
          all  that is left is to place them right. There are two
          kinds ob buttons: fixed and floating buttons.  A  fixed
          button  is  forced to a specific slot in the button box
          by a x/y geometry argument. All other buttons are  con-
          sidered  floating.  Fixed  buttons  are  placed  first.
          Should a fixed button overlap another one or  shall  be
          place  outside  the  buttons  window, FvwmButtons exits
          with an error message.  After that the floating buttons
          are  placed.   The algorithm tries to place the buttons
          in a left to right, top to bottom western fashion. If a
          button  fits  at  the  suggested  position it is placed
          there, if not the current slot stays empty and the slot
          to  the  right will be considered. After the button has
          been placed, the next button is tried to be  placed  in
          the  next  slot and so on until all buttons are placed.
          Additional rows are added below the bottom line of but-
          tons  until  all buttons are placed if necessary if the
          BoxSize option <font color="yellow">smart</font color="yellow"> is used.

     Containers
          Containers are arranged by the same algorithm, in  fact
          they  are  shuffled  recursively as the algorithm finds
          them.

     Clarifying example
          An example might be useful here:  Suppose  you  have  6
          buttons,  all  unit  sized  except number two, which is
          2x2. This makes for 5 times 1 plus 1 times 4  equals  9
          unit  buttons  total  area. Assume you have requested 3
          columns.

          1) +---+---+---+   2) +---+---+---+   3) +---+---+---+
             | 1 |       |      | 1 |       |      | 1 |       |
             +---+       +      +---+   2   +      +---+   2   +
             |           |      |   |       |      | 3 |       |
             +           +      +   +---+---+      +---+---+---+
             |           |      |           |      |   |   |   |
             +-----------+      +---+-------+      +---+---+---+

          4) +---+---+---+   5) +---+-------+   6) +---+-------+
             | 1 |       |      | 1 |       |      | 1 |       |
             +---+   2   +      +---+   2   |      +---+   2   |
             | 3 |       |      | 3 |       |      | 3 |       |
             +---+---+---+      +---+---+---+      +---+-------+
             | 4 |       |      | 4 | 5 |   |      | 4 | 5 | 6 |
             +---+---+---+      +---+---+---+      +---+---+---+


     What size will the buttons be?
          When FvwmButtons has read the icons and fonts that  are
          required  by  its  configuration, it can find out which
          size is needed for  every  non-swallowing  button.  The
          unit  button  size  of  a  container is set to be large
          enough to hold the largest button in it without squeez-
          ing  it.  Swallowed  windows  are simply expected to be
          comfortable with the  buttonsize  they  get  from  this
          scheme.  If  a  particular  configuration requires more
          space for a swallowed window, it can  be  set  in  that
          button's  configuration  line  using  the  option "Size
          <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">height</font color="yellow">". This will tell FvwmButtons to give  this
          button  at  least  <font color="yellow">width</font color="yellow">  by  <font color="yellow">height</font color="yellow">  pixels inside the
          relief and padding.

     The last lines are a little tricky - one spawns an FvwmPager
     module, and captures it to display in a quadruple width but-
     ton.  is used, the Pager will be as big as  possible  within
     the button's relief.

     The final line is even more magic. Note the  combination  of
     <font color="yellow">UseOld</font color="yellow">  and  <font color="yellow">NoKill</font color="yellow">,  which  will try to swallow an existing
     window with the name "xload15" when starting up (if failing:
     starting  one  with the specified command), which is unswal-
     lowed when ending FvwmButtons.

     The other panels are specified after the root panel:


     ########## PANEL
     *FvwmButtonsPanel WinOps
     *FvwmButtonsBack bisque2
     *FvwmButtonsGeometry -3-3
     *FvwmButtonsColumns 1

     *FvwmButtons(Title Move  ,Icon arrows2.xpm,Action Move  )
     *FvwmButtons(Title Lower ,Icon Down       ,Action Lower )
     *FvwmButtons(Title Raise ,Icon Up         ,Action Raise )

     ########## PANEL

     *FvwmButtonsGeometry -1-1
     *FvwmButtonsColumns 1

     *FvwmButtons(Title Kill  ,Icon bomb.xpm   ,Action Destroy)


     The color specification <font color="yellow">rgb</font color="yellow">:<font color="yellow">90</font color="yellow">/<font color="yellow">80</font color="yellow">/<font color="yellow">90</font color="yellow"> is  actually  the  most
     correct  way  of  specifying  independent  colors  in X, and
     should be used instead of the older #<font color="yellow">908090</font color="yellow">. If  the  latter
     specification is used in your configuration file, you should
     be sure to escape the hash in any of the <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">s which will
     be  executed,  or  fvwm will consider the rest of the line a
     comment.

     Note that with the x/y geometry specs you can  easily  build
     button  windows  with gaps. Here is another example. You can
     not accomplish this without geometry specs for the buttons:
