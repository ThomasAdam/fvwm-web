<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow"> - the FVWM Event module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow"> is a more versatile replacement for <font color="yellow">FvwmAudio</font color="yellow">.  It
     can  in general be used to hook any <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> function or program
     to any window manager event. E.g: Delete  unwanted  Netscape
     Pop  ups  or  application error pop ups as they appear, play
     sounds, log events to a file  and  the  like.  Be  creative,
     You'll find a use for it.

     <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow"> is spawned by <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">, so no command line  invocation
     will  work.   From  within  the  .<font color="yellow">fvwm2rc</font color="yellow"> file, <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow"> is
     spawned as follows:

     Module FvwmEvent

     or from within an <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> pop-up menu:

     DestroyMenu Module-Popup
     AddToMenu Module-Popup "Modules" Title
     + "Event"        Module FvwmEvent
     + "Auto"         Module FvwmAuto 200
     + "Buttons"      Module FvwmButtons
     + "Console"      Module FvwmConsole
     + "Ident"        Module FvwmIdent
     + "Banner"       Module FvwmBanner
     + "Pager"        Module FvwmPager 0 3



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow">  module  communicates  with  the  <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">  window
     manager to bind <font color="yellow">actions</font color="yellow"> to window manager <font color="yellow">events</font color="yellow">.  Different
     actions may be assigned to distinct window manager events.

     <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow"> can be used to bind sound  files  to  events  like
     <font color="yellow">FvwmAudio</font color="yellow"> (RiP) did. It can be used for logging event traces
     to a log file, while debugging <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">.

     <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow"> can  also  have  builtin  support  for  the  rplay
     library.  (heritage of FvwmAudio)



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
     The invocation method was shown in the synopsis section.  No
     command  line  invocation  is  possible.  <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow">  must be
     invoked by the <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> window manager. <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow"> accepts a sin-
     gle argument:


     -audio
          Enables FvwmAudio compatibility mode.

     alias
          Makes FvwmEvent use <font color="yellow">alias</font color="yellow"> as  its  name.  This  affects
          which  lines  from  the  user's  configuration file are
          used.

          Invoking FvwmEvent as <font color="yellow">FvwmAudio</font color="yellow">  (either  by  using  an
          alias or creating a symlink) enables FvwmAudio compati-
          bility mode.





</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow"> reads the same .<font color="yellow">fvwm2rc</font color="yellow"> file as <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> reads when it
     starts up, and looks for certain configuration options:


     *FvwmEvent: Cmd <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">
          This determines the <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> function that is to be  called
          with  the event parameters. You might want to do one of
          the following (details below):

               # play sounds
               *FvwmEvent: Cmd <font color="yellow">builtin</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">rplay</font color="yellow">

               # execute distinct fvwm functions
               *FvwmEvent: Cmd

               # execute distinct external programs
               *FvwmEvent: Cmd exec

          This version of <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow">  has  builtin  <font color="yellow">rplay</font color="yellow">  support
          which  does not need to invoke an external audio player
          to play sounds.  The  rplay  support  is  enabled  when
          <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow">  is compiled with <font color="yellow">HAVE</font color="yellow">_<font color="yellow">RPLAY</font color="yellow"> defined and when
          <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow">: <font color="yellow">Cmd</font color="yellow"> is set  to  <font color="yellow">builtin</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">rplay</font color="yellow">.  See  remarks
          below  if <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow"> is invoked in FvwmAudio compatibil-
          ity mode.

          For example:

               *FvwmEvent: Cmd <font color="yellow">builtin</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">rplay</font color="yellow">
               *FvwmEvent: add_window drip.au

          rplay can be obtained via anonymous ftp at

               &lt;URL:ftp://ftp.sdsu.edu/pub/rplay&gt; or
               &lt;URL:ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/Event/audio/rplay&gt;

          <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow"> also has support for any other external  pro-
          gram.  e.g: the rsynth 'say' command:

               *FvwmEvent: Cmd Exec /rsynth/say
               *FvwmEvent: destroy_window "window closed"

          You  can  also  use  <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">'s  builtin  <font color="yellow">Echo</font color="yellow">  command  as
          <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow">:  <font color="yellow">Cmd</font color="yellow">  to obtain debug output for <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> events
          quietly.  I used this setup to debug FvwmAuto:

               *FvwmEvent: Cmd <font color="yellow">Echo</font color="yellow">
               *FvwmEvent: focus_change "focus change"
               *FvwmEvent: raise_window "raise window"

          You can even call different  shell  commands  for  each
          event just by setting

               *FvwmEvent: Cmd exec
               *FvwmEvent: add_window killname "APPL ERROR"


     *FvwmEvent: PassID
          Specifies that the event action will have an ID parame-
          ter  added  to the end of the command line. Most events
          will have the windowID of the  window  that  the  event
          refers  to, new_desk will have the new desk number. The
          windowID is a hexadecimal string preceded by  0x,  desk
          numbers are decimal.


     *FvwmEvent: <font color="yellow">window</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">manager</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">event</font color="yellow"> <font color="yellow">action</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">or</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">filename</font color="yellow">
          Binds particular actions to window manager events.

          e.g. for audio-events:

               *FvwmEvent: startup TaDa.au
               *FvwmEvent: shutdown Elvis_Left.au
               *FvwmEvent: unknown doh.au

               *FvwmEvent: new_page beam_trek.au
               *FvwmEvent: new_desk beam_trek.au
               *FvwmEvent: add_window drip.au
               *FvwmEvent: raise_window swoosh.au
               *FvwmEvent: lower_window swoosh.au
               *FvwmEvent: configure_window hammer.au
               *FvwmEvent: focus_change boing.au
               *FvwmEvent: destroy_window explosion.au
               *FvwmEvent: iconify ploop.au
               *FvwmEvent: deiconify ploop.au
               *FvwmEvent: window_name huh.au
               *FvwmEvent: icon_name beep.au
               *FvwmEvent: res_class beep.au
               *FvwmEvent: res_name beep.au
               *FvwmEvent: end_windowlist twang.au

               *FvwmEvent: icon_location beep.au
               *FvwmEvent: map beep.au
               *FvwmEvent: error beep.au
               *FvwmEvent: config_info beep.au
               *FvwmEvent: end_config_info beep.au
               *FvwmEvent: icon_file beep.au
               *FvwmEvent: default_icon beep.au
               *FvwmEvent: string plapper.au

               *FvwmEvent: mini_icon beep.au
               *FvwmEvent: windowshade beep.au
               *FvwmEvent: dewindowshade beep.au

          Provided <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> supports it (not yet), there's  an  addi-
          tional event to replace all <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> beeps with a sound:

               *FvwmEvent: beep beep.au

          The toggle_paging event will be supported, as soon,  as
          it's resurrected by <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">:

               *FvwmEvent: toggle_paging fwop.au


     *FvwmEvent: Delay <font color="yellow">5</font color="yellow">
          Specifies that an event-action will only be executed if
          it  occurs at least 5 seconds after the previous event.
          Events that occur during the delay period are  ignored.
          This  option is useful if you don't want several sounds
          playing at the same time.  The default delay is 0 which
          disables the Event delay.


     *FvwmEvent: StartDelay <font color="yellow">delay</font color="yellow">
          Specifies that an event-action will only be executed if
          it  occurs  at  least  <font color="yellow">delay</font color="yellow">  seconds after the startup
          event. Events that occur during the  delay  period  are
          ignored.   This  option  is useful when <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> starts and
          restarts using an audio player.  The default  delay  is
          0.



</PRE>
<H2>RPLAY OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     The following options are only valid with builtin rplay sup-
     port.   i.e:  when  <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow">  was  compiled with <font color="yellow">HAVE</font color="yellow">_<font color="yellow">RPLAY</font color="yellow">
     defined.  They are used only if <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow">:  <font color="yellow">Cmd</font color="yellow">  is  set  to
     <font color="yellow">builtin</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">rplay</font color="yellow">.



     *FvwmEvent: RplayHost <font color="yellow">hostname</font color="yellow">
          Specifies what host the rplay sounds will play on.  The
          <font color="yellow">hostname</font color="yellow">  can  also  be an environment variable such as
          $HOSTDISPLAY.


     *FvwmEvent: RplayPriority <font color="yellow">0</font color="yellow">
          Specifies what priority will be assigned to  the  rplay
          sounds when they are played.


     *FvwmEvent: RplayVolume <font color="yellow">127</font color="yellow">
          Specifies what volume will be assigned  to  the  sounds
          when they are played.



</PRE>
<H2>FvwmAudio Compatibility Mode</H2><PRE>
     When invoked in FvwmAudio compatibility  mode  (see  above),
     FvwmEvent accepts the following options to provide backwards
     compatibility for FvwmAudio:


     *FvwmEvent: PlayCmd <font color="yellow">command</font color="yellow">
          This is equivalent to using  *FvwmEvent:  Cmd  to  Exec
          commands.  This determines the independent audio player
          program that will actually play the sounds. If the play
          command  is set to <font color="yellow">builtin</font color="yellow">-<font color="yellow">rplay</font color="yellow"> then the builtin rplay
          support will be used.


     *FvwmAudio: Dir <font color="yellow">directory</font color="yellow">
          Specifies the directory to look for  the  audio  files.
          This option is ignored when rplay is used.



</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     It's REALLY noisy when <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> starts  and  restarts  using  an
     audio player.  You can use FvwmEvent: StartDelay to fix this
     problem.



</PRE>
<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>
     This module has evolved  of  <font color="yellow">FvwmAudio</font color="yellow">,  which  in  term  is
     heavily  based  on a similar Fvwm module called <font color="yellow">FvwmSound</font color="yellow"> by
     Mark Boyns. <font color="yellow">FvwmAudio</font color="yellow"> simply took  Mark's  original  program
     and  extended  it to make it generic enough to work with any
     Audio player. Due  to  different  requests  to  do  specific
     things  on  specific  events,  <font color="yellow">FvwmEvent</font color="yellow">  took this one step
     further and now calls any <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow"> function,  or  builtin-rplay.
     If <font color="yellow">fvwm</font color="yellow">'s Exec function is used, any external program can be
     called with any parameter.

     The concept  for  interfacing  this  module  to  the  Window
     Manager, is original work by Robert Nation.
