FVWM would not have been possible without the tails, ears and the little
paws of the coziest beings in the world: our cats. Well, perhaps we could
have done without the paws. If your pet ever walked straight over your
keyboard, chased your mouse pointer (yes, I know cats are supposed to catch
mice, but still...) or fell asleep on your trackball you know what I mean.

<p><font size=+2>Dominik's cats:</font>
<p><b><tt><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Kassandra</font></font></tt></b>
<br>female, * 1989, + on 23rd of June in 2000 (bitten to death by a dog)
<br><img SRC="kassandra.jpg" VSPACE=2 BORDER=3 height=349 width=536>
<br>Kassandra was my favourite before I got Niniel, Luthien and Tilion.
I had to leave her behind when I moved to Southern Germany. I loved her
very much and I did not want to force her to move with me. We got them
at the age of 1 and a half years and it took three month before she came
down from the heating pipes in our cellar.
<p><b><tt><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Luthien</font></font></tt></b>
<br>female, * 13th of September 1998, + run over by a car on 18th of March
1999)
<br><img SRC="luthien.jpg" VSPACE=2 BORDER=3 height=385 width=620>
<br>Was the most beautiful kitten I've ever seen. She was my favourite
cat the instant I saw her (she was hiding in the attic and hissed when
I came too close). Had the strongest character and the largest eyes of
the three. I miss her so much!
<p><b><tt><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Niniel</font></font></tt></b>
<br>(full name: Niniel Nienor), female, * 13th of September 1998
<br><img SRC="niniel.jpg" VSPACE=2 BORDER=3 height=385 width=612>
<br>The smallest and cutest of my three cats. A saucy little whirlwind
that loves piddling on my bed and sofa. I have to find a better photograph.
<p><b><tt><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Tilion</font></font></tt></b>
<br>(male, * 13th of September 1998)
<br><img SRC="tilion.jpg" VSPACE=2 BORDER=3 height=284 width=426 align=TEXTTOP>
<br>The biggest of my three cats. Hobbies: feeding and squawking. Once
we tested when Tilion would stop feeding, but had to break off the experiment
when we ran out of cat food.
<p><b><tt><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Geoffrey and Pepper</font></font></tt></b>
<br>male, * 1988, Pepper missing for years now (picture of Geoffrey below)
<br><img SRC="geoffrey.jpg" VSPACE=2 BORDER=3 height=486 width=693 align=TEXTTOP>
<br>Two big black tomcats with a few white patches on the belly. Most of
the time when not feeding or sleeping they stray around the neighbourhood.
Geoffrey is the terror of the cats in the area. I had to leave him behind
when I moved to Althengstett.
<p><b><tt><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Blacky and Tiger</font></font></tt></b>
<br>female and male, * 1980, Tiger was given away when he was one and a
half years old, Blacky was shot by a forest warden in 1987.
<br><img SRC="blacky-tiger.jpg" VSPACE=2 BORDER=3 height=431 width=815>
<br>I can hardly remember those two. Tiger was given away because he slobbered
in the lap of our visitors (we never forgave our parents). Have you seen
his ears? Perhaps we had better called him 'Radar'. Blacky was a great
hunter and the most undemanding cat we had. She suffered terribly when
she was shot before the doctor put her to sleep.

<p><font size=+2>Dan's cat:</font>
<p><b><tt><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Angel</font></font></tt></b>
<br>Rescued from the front window of a deli, Angel leads an indoor cats
life. To save our furniture Angel's front claws are removed. I believe,
as a direct consequence, she's one of the most dangerous cats I've encountered.
Thats right, watch out for this cat, she bites, hard.

<p><font size=+2>Hippo's cats:</font>
<p><b><tt><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Corky</font></font></tt></b>
<br>Champion rat catcher. Proper name Corkscrew because he spent the first
five minutes of his life going around in circles until he discovered that
he had hind legs.
<br><img SRC="corky.jpg" VSPACE=2 BORDER=3 height=414 width=518>
<p><b><tt><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Scotty</font></font></tt></b>
<br>A Garfield fan. Originally named after Robert Falcon Scott the famous
(if you're British) polar explorer as she was the first kitten to make
it to the top the curtains and the only cat I know of to have gone up the
inside of a pair of trousers hanging in a wardrobe. She has since lost
the travel bug and spends her time testing the sofa for long term comfort.
<br><img SRC="scott.jpg" VSPACE=2 BORDER=3 height=414 width=518>
<p><b><tt><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Sir Boris II</font></font></tt></b>
<br>A strange looking cat with a taste for grass, carrots, bananas and
blackcurrant juice.
<br><img SRC="boris.jpg" VSPACE=2 BORDER=3 height=414 width=259>

<p><font size=+2>Bob's cat:</font>
<p><b><tt><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Tiny</font></font></tt></b>
<br>A playful lynx-point Siamese, she probably understands more about the
FVWM code than I do by now.

One of these days, I'll try to get a picture of her in a debugging session,
and a picture of her sister.

<p><b><tt><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Murzilka</font></font></tt></b>

with a mouse pointer on the monitor and watch dynamic screensavers (geek
cat?).

<p><font size=+2>Brad's cat:</font>
<p><b><tt><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Blaise</font></font></tt></b>
<br>You guessed it Blaise after Blaise Pascal, what else would you expect
from a programmer, and a math loving wife. Blaise is in her usual spot
waiting for dinner, she is good at telling time her clock is just an hour
fast.
