	  Only the root menu and the decorations are really fvwm-like.
	  I like gtk so I am using gnome's panels (top and bottom, left hand side).
	  There's an aterm window using transparency, gqmpeg and netscape, and, of
	  course, gkrellm running.
	  For the colors, I used grdb and grdb2fvwm, which takes gnome's colors
	  and fonts and puts it into my fvwm2rc. it's quite useful, I think.

	  Title bars, borders, menues and pagers (invisible at the moment) are all fully

	  in three aterms on the right side of the screen. Below that xchat and a small
	  gkrellm. On the left, there's mutt in an Eterm. The nice background is done

	  have a light marble GTK+ theme that I've extended manually onto my FVWM
	  buttons, and a custom icon or two.  I made the blue Vampire Princess Miyu
	  background for the Eterm, and threw Vampire Princess Miyu skins that I
	  found onto Licq and xmms.  I also customized the title bars a bit with a
	  textured background that fits in with the overall blueness of the Miyu

This screenshot is intended to show the versatility of FvwmButtons.
FvwmButtons can swallow programs as well as menu items.
There are 3 separate FvwmButton panels active on this desktop.
MyBar1 is the button on the right, and runs xbuffy, which monitors my
incoming mail.
MyBar2, the bar across the bottom contains menu items and the FvwmPager.
I have 24 active desktops.
The labeling, F1, F2, etc. tells me which key combination to hit to
go to that desktop.
MyBar3, which takes up the bulk of the screen, holds several programs
I constantly run and need quick access to.
All 3 bars are easily iconized and removed from the screen with a
simple key stroke designed specifically for that individual bar,
leaving me a clean and open desktop to run additional programs.

This screenshot demonstrates the WindowShade feature.
Instead of using icons, you can scroll the window up into
the titlebar.
The left buttons on the titlebar are created using vectors.
The right buttons are pixmaps.
All the buttons are user definable which further demonstrates

The basic rules guiding this <a href="J_C_Lawrence.fvwm2rc">setup</a>:
<ul>
<li>
 Modal interfaces are evil.
<li>
 No icons will ever appear on any system I run.  
<li>
 Nothing ever gets dragged, nothing ever gets dropped.
<li>
 There will be no system controls which are bound to or only
 accessible via particular locations on the screen.
<li>
 Key bindings/keyboard acceleration is your friend.
<li>
 No Z-order limits on any controls or feature accessibility.
<li>
 All controls must be accessible and controllable without
 requiring prior access (such as by changing z-order or moving a
 window out of the way (BAD!)), or to any other particular window
 or X or WM widget or device.

This is a screen shot of fvwm mimicking the cde environment.
The setup features motif-style window decorations and
shadow/hilight color calculations.  The colors are calculated in
a perl script, which also generates .xresources and .gtkrc files
so that a consistent color scheme is used throughout all
applications.  In addition, given background pixmaps are colored
in the same colors, who on turn are reflected in the colors of
the buttons on the pager.  To mimic the cde front panel (in the
bottom) I used the gnome panel with some custom applets added.
Left to be done to fully get the cde look are window decorations
for icons.

This is an Xinerama desktop showing some interesting side mounted titles,
flat borders and gradients in the titlebars.
The
<a href="Marc_A_Lehmann.fvwm2rc">config file</a>
is M4 based and contains some interesting stuff too.

Mark says:
... features XineramaSls, a really old fvwm config incrementally
updated to fvwm2 over the years. The config tries to implement the
following:
<ul>
<li>clean and reasonably fast (ok, gradients crept in over time ;)
<li>the active window must be very visible
<li>lots of virtual desktops, overlaps reduced to the minimum
<li>no unnecessary clutter, large terminals
<li>syslog on root-window using root-tail
</ul>

Len says:
it's simple (no transparent
terminals, multiple modules, etc., etc), but that might be a nice
contrast to all the "walk and talk" .fvwm2rc's out there. It does have
custom pixmaps buttons and titlebar, along with FvwmButtons on the
taskbar...
I'd like
to combine the maximize and restore buttons into one.
<p>
The question mark button brings up a form containing choices for all the
FVWM man pages, which launch in their own xterms.
