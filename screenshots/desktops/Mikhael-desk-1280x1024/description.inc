Submitted by Mikhael Goikhman. This is a mix of different
<a href="http://fvwm-themes.sf.net/">fvwm-themes</a> components
plus some additional commands in FvwmConsole. This screenshot shows
new 2.5.x features like transparent FvwmPager in the upper left, png
icons from <a href="http://wm-icons.sf.net/">wm-icons</a> package,
tinted transparent menus, multipixmap titlebars, FvwmButtons on the
bottom that badly simulates the RedmondXP panel (it is managed by
fvwm module written in perl), icons tinted differently in menus,
shadow text and FreeType fonts. On the right is gkrellm.

<p>A similar configuration is availaible out of the box in fvwm-themes 0.7.0
or greater.
