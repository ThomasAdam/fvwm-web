Question to Tavis: The icons on the left side - are
generated automatically - do they change if the window
contents changes?<br>

Tavis: They are generated automatically, the icons are little screenshots of
the windows before they were iconified, pretty simple to do with the new
WindowStyle command, but they look really cool :)
