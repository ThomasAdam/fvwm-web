A third  one by An Thi-Nguyen Le.   Here's also a screenshot
	  of a   mockup of Gnutopia, a  rather  cheery BlackBox theme,
	  with  the large   pager  retracted (another  thing I  fooled
	  around  with.  Actually, all  the  buttons retract, just for
	  the heck  of  it).    Cheery happy  yellowy  and   all that.
