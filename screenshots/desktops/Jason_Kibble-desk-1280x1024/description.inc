	  This is my current favorite fvwm theme. The buttons and gradients
	  are based on an E fvwm theme which I thought looked quite spiffy.
	  As you can see I'm playing with FvwmButtons and FvwmTheme. I'm
	  never totally happy with what I come up with so this current
	  one has probably changed since this shot was taken.
