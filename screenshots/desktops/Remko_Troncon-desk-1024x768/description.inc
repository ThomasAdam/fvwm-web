This screenshot shows a clean and simple desktop.
On the top left
is FvwmButtons which opens panels of apps I use frequently for a 
very short time (like IM's). On the top right, 
<A HREF="http://www.gkrellm.net">GKrellM</A> is showing
all the things I like to monitor. The bottom right corner contains
FvwmPager. The background is generated by 
<A HREF="http://xplanet.sourceforge.net/">Xplanet</A>.
The fonts show the anti-aliasing support of FVWM.
The icons in the menus are mostly taken from the 
<A HREF="http://wm-icons.sourceforge.net/">wm-icons</A> distribution.
