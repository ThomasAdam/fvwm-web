By An  Thi-Nguyen   Le.  I got  really  really procrast-- I mean, bored, and
fooled around with FvwmTheme for a while.  This particular scheme is
borrowing heavily from the Enlightenment theme AbsoluteE (the blue version)
and makes heavy use of the stretching pixmap feature of FvwmTheme.  The
background is Tigert's Blue Space, the GKrellM theme is something obscure
called 3051.
