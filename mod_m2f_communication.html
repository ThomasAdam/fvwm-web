<h2><font color="turquoise">
Module Writing
</font></h2>
Before you write a module, you will want to look at a few different
fvwm modules. The techniques used have evolved over time, and no
one module contains all the best techniques. Some of them may be on
this page, but undoubtedly some of them are buried in the source code.
<h2><font color="turquoise">
Module communications protocol
</font></h2>
Modules communicate with fvwm via a simple protocol. In essence, a
textual command line, similar to a command line which could be bound
to a mouse, or key-stroke in the .fvwm2rc, is transmitted to fvwm.
<p>
First the module should send the ID of the window which should be
manipulated. A window ID of ``None'' may be used, in which case Fvwm
will prompt the user to select a window if needed. Next the length of
the the command line is sent as an integer. After that the command
line itself is sent. Finally, an integer 1 is sent if the module plans
to continue operating, or 0 if the module is finished. The following
subroutine is provided as an example of a suitable method of sending
messages to fvwm:
<font color="yellow"><pre>
void SendText(int *fd, char *message, unsigned long window) {
  int w;
  if (message != NULL) {
      write(fd[0],&amp;win,sizeof(Window));
      w=strlen(message);                /* calc the length of the message */
      write(fd[0],&amp;w,sizeof(int));  /* send the message length */
      write(fd[0],message,w);           /* send the message itself */
      /* send a 1, indicating that this module will keep going */
      /* a 0 would mean that this module is done */
      w=1;
      write(fd[0],&amp;w,sizeof(int));
  }
}

</pre></font>
This routine is available as a library function in libfvwm.
For compatibility with older code, there is a macro "SendInfo"
which can be used instead of the function name SendText.
<h2><font color="turquoise">
Module information requests
</font></h2>
There are special built-in functions, SendWindowList and Send_ConfigInfo.
SendWindowList causes fvwm to transmit everything that it is
currently thinking about to the module which requests the information.
This information contains the paging status (enabled/disabled),
current desktop number, position on the desktop, current focus and,
for each window, the window configuration, window, icon, and class
names, and, if the window is iconified, the icon location and size.
For example, some modules during start up want to know the state of
all current windows.  The would ask fvwm for this information like this:
<font color="yellow"><pre>
SendText(Channel,"SendWindowList",0);

</pre></font>
Send_ConfigInfo causes fvwm to send the module a list of all some or all
commands it has received which start with a ``*'', as well as the
some global settings that fvwm is currently using.
This is implemented in fvwm/modconf.c.
Note that "Send_ConfigInfo" is sort of a memory dump type request,
and the number of commands a module might get from this request
may change over time. The module should be prepared to ignore commands
it is not interested in without generating a warning or error.
This request is normally made during module startup for a module
to read its current configuration and some general information.
Fvwm provides some subroutines to make this process fairly painless.
Here is an example from FvwmAnimate.c:
<font color="yellow"><pre>
static void ParseOptions() {
  char *buf;
  InitGetConfigInfo(Channel,MyName);  /* char *MyName = "*FvwmAnimate" */
  while (GetConfigLine(Channel,&buf), buf != NULL) {
    ParseConfigLine(buf);
  }
}

</pre></font>
The call to "InitGetConfigInfo" is optional. If a module wants all
the module commands (commands starting with ``*''), there is no
need to use this command. Most modules only want module commands for
the module itself. As shown in the example above, the second argument includes
the leading asterisk. The match is case insensitive.
<p>
InitGetConfigInfo improves performance. Since the command matching is done in
fvwm2, time is saved in both fvwm2 and the module. Remember that the module
still has to name match if it wants to find its own configuration lines since
other kinds of commands are sent along with module configuration lines.
<h2><font color="turquoise">
Controlling information sent to modules
</font></h2>
Fvwm lets each module control exactly what information is passed
to the module. A module can send the command Set_Mask, followed by
a number which is the bitwise OR of the packet-types the module
wishes to receive. If the module never sends the Set_Mask command,
then all message types in the default mask are sent. The default
mask is defined in fvwm_module_interface.h as "MAX_MASK" and
"DEFAULT_XMSG_MASK". This currently (January 2002) includes all
messages except M_SENDCONFIG and all of the MX_... messages.
A library function, SetMessageMask, makes it easy to set this
mask. Since 2.5.0 was released, the highest bit in the message
mask marks extended messages that were introduced to allow more
than 32 message types.  The type of a message received by a module
can be compared against one of the macros in libs/Module.h as
usual, but when passing a mask to the SetMessageMask, SetSyncMask
or SetNoGrabMask functions, the normal and extended masks must be
set in separate calls.
Here is an example from FvwmGtk.c:
<font color="yellow"><pre>
SetMessageMask(fvwm_fd, M_STRING | M_CONFIG_INFO | M_SENDCONFIG | ...);
SetMessageMask(fvwm_fd, MX_VISIBLE_ICON_NAME);

</pre></font>
This mask is used to reduce the amount of communication between
fvwm and its modules so that a module only gets the messages it
needs.

<h2><font color="turquoise"><a name="M_SENDCONFIG"></a>
Dynamic reconfiguration
</font></h2>
Fvwm can change configuration whilst running and modules can also share this
ability. The <tt><font color="yellow">while(GetConfigLine())</font></tt>
loop gets the current configuration but other module config lines may be added
at any time from a variety of sources.  If a module wants to be notified of
any configuration changes it must set the <em>M_SENDCONFIG</em> bit in the
event mask

<H2> <font color="turquoise">Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Operation</font></h2>
A module normally runs asynchrously with fvwm2. For example FvwmPager
may be updating its display to show a window being iconified while fvwm2 may
have already iconfied and de-iconified the window. This is usually desirable.
Other modules might need to synchronize (a part of) their processing with
fvwm. If this is the case, the module must nform fvwm which packet-types
it wishes to be processed synchronously. There is a mask for this propose.
A library function, SetSyncMask, allows this mask to be set.
Here is an example from FvwmAnimate.c:
<font color="yellow"><pre>
SetSyncMask(Channel,M_ICONIFY|M_DEICONIFY|M_STRING);
</pre></font>
When this mask is set, every message in the mask sent to the
module from fvwm must be answered with an "UNLOCK" message.
FvwmAnimate is the first module to implement this and should be
used as a reference implementation. Note that FvwmAnimate sends the command
"UNLOCK 1". The "1" is currently ignored but may be used in the future.
This facility comes from Afterstep, and we are just tracking what they
have done. The Afterstep documentation doesn't seem to say, but most
likely this is the time in seconds that fvwm should wait for the module
to respond with "UNLOCK" before it proceeds without the module's response.
